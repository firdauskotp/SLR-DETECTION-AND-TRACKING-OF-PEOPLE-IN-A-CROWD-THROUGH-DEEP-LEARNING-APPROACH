While body scanner systems in secure areas of public places are becoming more and more efficient, the attack at Brussels airport on 22 March 2016, upstream of these systems, in the middle of the crowd of passengers, demonstrated the lack of discreet and real-time security against threats of mass terrorism. The NATO-SPS international and multi-year DEXTER project aims to provide new technical and strategic solutions to fill this gap. This project is based on multi-sensor coordination and fusion, from hyperspectral remote laser to smart glasses, artificial algorithms, and suspect identification and tracking. One of these sensors is dedicated to threat detection (large weapon or explosive belt) using the clothing of pedestrians by means of an active microwave component. This project is referred to as MIC (Microwave Imaging Curtain), also supported by the French SGDSN (General Secretariat of Defense and National Security), and utilizes a radar system capable of generating 3D images in real-time to address non-checkpoint detection of explosives and firearms. The project, led by ONERA (France), is based on a radar imaging system developed by the Fraunhofer FHR institute, using a MIMO architecture with an Ultra-Wide Band waveform. Although high-resolution 3D microwave imaging is already being used in expensive body scanners to detect firearms concealed under clothing, MIC's innovative approach lies in utilizing a high-resolution 3D imaging device that can detect larger dangerous objects carried by moving individuals at a longer range, in addition to providing discrete detection in pedestrian flow. Automatic detection and classification of these dangerous objects is carried out on 3D radar images using a deep-learning network. This paper will outline the project's objectives and constraints, as well as the design, architecture, and performance of the final system. Additionally, it will present real-time imaging results obtained during a live demonstration in a relevant environment.",,

Different types of methods, such as CNN-based, autoencoder-based, GAN-based, and transformer-based methods, have been proposed. Deep learning-based methods have undoubtedly become dominant methods for the VIF task. However, while much progress has been made, the field will benefit from a systematic review of these deep learning-based methods. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of deep learning-based VIF methods. We discuss motivation, taxonomy, recent development characteristics, datasets, and performance evaluation methods in detail. We also discuss future prospects of the VIF field.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends preventing COVID-19 from spreading in public areas. On the other hand, people may not be maintaining the required 2-m physical distance as a mandated safety precaution in shopping malls and public places. The spread of the fatal disease may be slowed by an active monitoring system suitable for identifying distances between people and alerting them. This paper introduced a deep learning-based system for automatically detecting physical distance using video from security cameras. The proposed system introduced the TH-YOLOv5 for object detection and classification and Deepsort for tracking the detected people using bounding boxes from the video. TH-YOLOv5 included another prediction head to identify objects of varying sizes. The original prediction heads are then replaced with Transformer Heads (TH) to investigate the prediction capability of the self-attention mechanism. Then, we include the convolutional block attention model (CBAM) to identify attention areas in settings with dense objects. Pairwise L2 vectorized normalization was utilized to generate a three-dimensional feature space for tracking physical distances and the violation index, determining the number of individuals who follow the distance rules. We use the MS COCO and HumanCrowd, CityPersons, and Oxford Town Centre (OTC) data sets for training and testing.

The central concerns incorporate the detachment of the foreground from the scene and the understanding of the contextual structure of the environment for efficiently identifying unusual objects. In our work, we introduced a novel framework to tackle these difficulties by presenting a semantic segmentation technique for separating a foreground object. In our work, Super-pixels are generated using an improved watershed transform and then a conditional random field is implemented to obtain multi-object segmented frames by performing pixel-level labeling. Next, the Social Force model is introduced to extract the contextual structure of the environment via the fusion of a novel chosen particular histogram of an optical stream and inner force model. After using the computed social force, multi-people tracking is performed via three-dimensional template association using percentile rank and non-maximal suppression. Next, multi-object categorization is performed via deep learning Feature Pyramid Network. Finally, by considering the contextual structure of the environment, Jaccard similarity is utilized to make the decision for abnormality detection and identify the unusual objects from the scene.

Considering crowd group as a multi-object tracking problem can often lead to computational burden and frequent target mismatch due to numerous occlusions, whereas a single window can efficiently focus on the target. Recent progress on single object tracking (SOT) algorithms is achieved by learning a generic discriminator model from object tracking datasets, continuously updated during the testing steps. However, while tracking a group of crowd with a single window, the rigid discriminator can not generalize frequent group reformation, binomial dispersion, and crowd shape changes due to less knowledge about human-to-human interactions. To alleviate the issues, we propose a novel photo-realistic Unreal UAV Crowd Tracking (UUCT) dataset, which benchmarks aerial crowd group movements into several attributes.

In addition to conventional VIF methods, an increasing number of deep learning-based VIF methods have been proposed in the last five years. Different types of methods, such as CNN-based, autoencoder-based, GAN-based, and transformer-based methods, have been proposed. Deep learning-based methods have undoubtedly become dominant methods for the VIF task. However, while much progress has been made, the field will benefit from a systematic review of these deep learning-based methods. In this paper we present a comprehensive review of deep learning-based VIF methods. We discuss motivation, taxonomy, recent development characteristics, datasets, and performance evaluation methods in detail. We also discuss future prospects of the VIF field.

A small disaster can trigger panic in a huge crowd. Many intelligent video surveillance solutions can identify things, but despite the recent developments in artificial intelligence approaches and deep learning processes, it is very probable to track congested crowds and their mobility to avoid future detection disasters. Searching for points of interest makes use of movement analytics and classification to provide a superior platform for monitoring large crowds. The purpose of point-of-interest explorations is to aid in the management of the safety of moveable crowd events by assisting in the prediction and prevention of future disasters through the classification and analysis of real-time information gathered from crowds. Current surveillance cameras are insufficient for monitoring large crowds in outdoor locations due to their inability to scale. We believe that by using our proposed crowd analysis strategy, we may help enhance the current state of crowd safety management. Among the many aspects of crowd motion, we pay special attention to the difficulties of determining the identity, velocity, and direction of individuals inside the group. We then used these crowd-level semantics to monitor test POI searches in both a controlled lab environment and a real-world crowd. Findings from this study imply that POI searching can be utilized to help prevent harmful circumstances brought on by the movement of large crowds by recognizing the characteristics of mobile crowds in real time.",,978-1-6654-7524-2,10.1109/ESCI56872.2023.10099969,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099969,crowd congestion tracking;POI searching;artificial intelligence;machine learning;disaster preventive technique,Deep learning;Wireless communication;Tracking;Smart cities;Semantics;Streaming media;Video surveillance,,4,,25,IEEE,19-Apr-23

This disease can be easily spread to a group of people and increase the spread. Since it is a worldly disease and not plenty of vaccines available, social distancing is the only best approach to defend against the pandemic situation. All the affected countries' governments declared locked-down to implement social distancing. This social separation and persons not being in a mass group can slow down the spread of COVID19. It reduces the physical contact between infected persons and normal healthy persons. Almost every health organization tells that to follow social distancing people should maintain at least 6 feet of distance from each other. This research proposes a deep learning approach for social distancing which is developed for tracking and detecting people who are in indoor as well as outdoor scenarios using YOLO V3 video analytic technique. This approach focuses to inspect whether the people are maintaining social distancing in many areas, using surveillance video with measuring the distance in real-time performance. Most of the early studies of detecting social distance monitoring were based on GPS for tracking the movements of people where the signals could be lost. On the other hand, some countries use drones to detect large gatherings of people who cannot have a clear view at night times [10]. In the future, the proposed system can be used fully for detecting threats in the public crowded or it can detect any person affected by critical situations (ie fainting, Cordia arrest) or planting the crops in the forms evenly with a uniform measurement. This proposal could be used in many fields like crowd analysis, autonomous vehicles, and human action recognition and could help the government authorities to redesign the public place layout and take precautionary action in the risk zones.

The problem has been solved in three stages viz. detecting, identifying, and tracking the object in a particular zone, i.e., but it is observed that something more could be done in this field, mostly the MOT-A score was not up to the mark; hence the proposed research work utilized Kalman filters for obtaining enhanced results and compared the obtained MOT-A metric with previous works, and the results were good. Object detection and recognition occur via the YOLO algorithm, which enables us to classify the objects into 80 classes. Then, Motion Prediction and feature generation occur in which an estimation model is created, and Kalman filters are used to model these states for capturing moving objects in the frame. Finally, tracking takes place with Kalman filters in the previous frame, and newly detected objects are placed in the current frame, after which an association is made for new detection. All this is done via the DeepSORT algorithm, which is essentially a Deep association metric with the SORT algorithm. Here, Kalman filters are used as they improved the accuracy of the proposed model and yielded better results. On the same lines, YOLO is used to perform object detection and recognition at the same time. It is also a detector, which by applying a single neural network, it can predict the bounding boxes and perform multi-class classification. This problem can have various applications, especially in traffic management. It can also prevent people from gathering during COVID times and raising an alert for all the authorities.

However, the learning results of traditional methods cannot adapt to the dynamic changes of the simple scene, and thus have the disadvantage of poor generalization. To solve this problem, we propose a data-driven crowd evacuation framework based on hierarchical deep reinforcement learning. The framework consists of: a macro-control layer with path programming function and a micro control layer with collision avoidance function. In this paper, a path programming method combining data-driven and deep reinforcement learning is proposed in the macro-control layer. The method combines the pedestrian motion attributes in the video with the DDPG algorithm to learn the pedestrian track in the video from a macro perspective. In the micro-control layer, the track sequence learned in the macro-control layer is used as the motion target to learn the collision-free motion velocity of individuals using the multiple agent deep reinforcement learning method. When the scene changes, the micro-control layer adaptively adjusts the motion speed without the need for the macro-control layer to repeat the path programming learning. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical crowd evacuation framework can not only simulate the real crowd movement behavior and improve the simulation fidelity, but also flexibly adapt to the dynamic changes of the simple scene and enhance the generalization.",,978-1-7281-6597-4,10.1109/CSCWD49262.2021.9437632,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61972237,61876102,61762029); Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ZR2020LZH003); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9437632,Crowd evacuation;Route programming;Collision avoidance;Deep reinforcement learning,Training;Learning systems;Adaptation models;Target tracking;Conferences;Computational modeling;Dynamics,,10,,18,IEEE,28-May-21

View birdification becomes essential for mobile robot navigation and localization in dense crowds where the static background is hard to see and reliably track. It is challenging mainly for two reasons; i) absolute trajectories of pedestrians are entangled with the movement of the observer which needs to be decoupled from their observed relative movements in the ego-centric video, and ii) a crowd motion model describing the pedestrian movement interactions is specific to the scene yet unknown a priori. For this, we introduce a Transformer-based network referred to as ViewBirdiformer which implicitly models the crowd motion through self-attention and decomposes relative 2D movement observations onto the ground-plane trajectories of the crowd and the camera through cross-attention between views. Most important, ViewBirdiformer achieves view birdification in a single forward pass which opens the door to accurate real-time, always-on situational awareness.

Deep learning has dramatically been improving MOT performances. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art tracking algorithms are still sensitive to unexpected motion changes and the generic object target beyond person tracking. This is because standard MOT benchmark datasets such as MOT17 mainly consist of persons in a crowd, often lacking unexpected shape and motion changes; thus, these issues have yet to be focused on. We propose a simple-yet-effective MOT framework that can dynamically improve tracking continuity by associating each target based on adaptively modified motion states. The keys are 1) to represent the target motions using multiple motion states that have weak correlations with each other and 2) to modify those states that have the lowest similarity to past states as outliers. Our approach can improve trajectory continuity and robustness to unexpected motion changes for generic objects.

We take a low-quality image collection and utilize pre-processing techniques to improve its quality. Using the same experimental setting, we build YOLO and Faster R-CNN and evaluate their results based on accuracy and speed. After comparing the results it shows that in terms of detection speed, YOLO outperforms Faster R-CNN. And YOLO lags than Faster R-CNN when it comes to accuracy. Further we also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using these models and which is best suited for the scenario we intend to work on. Our findings give useful insights for the development of low-quality image object detection systems for accurate human detection in crowded images, with practical implications for a variety of applications.",2473-7674,979-8-3503-3509-5,10.1109/ICCCNT56998.2023.10307765,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10307765,Crowd detection;Deep Learning;Faster R-CNN;low-resolution images;object detection;YOLO,Training;Image resolution;Hardware;Task analysis;Testing,,,,18,IEEE,23-Nov-23

The intelligent monitoring of people’s social distances in crowds is one of the most significant events caused by the coronavirus. The virus is spreading more quickly among the crowds, and the disease cycle continues in congested areas. Due to the error that occurs when humans monitor their activity, an automated model is required to alert to social distance violations in crowds. As a result, this article proposes a two-step framework based on autonomous UAV videos, including human tracking and deep learning-based recognition of the crowd’s social distance. The deep architecture is a modified-fast and lightweight ShuffleNet learning structure. First, the Kalman filter is used to determine the positions of individuals, and then the modified ShuffleNet is used to refine the bounding boxes obtained and determine the social distance. The social distance is calculated using the initial refinement of the bounding box obtained during the tracking step and the scale in frames of the human body. The observed average accuracy, average processing time (APT), and processed frame per second (FPS) for three congestion datasets were 97.5%, 84 milliseconds, and 11.5 FPS, respectively.

Two fundamental challenges exist in solving our problem: i) different disaster events often have distinct characteristics (e.g., damage types, affected areas) that cannot be easily migrated; ii) it is non-trivial to modify a damage assessment model from a previous event to adapt to a new event without using the labeled data from the new event. To address the above challenges, we develop SocialTrans, a hybrid deep transfer learning framework, to enable effective model migration for accurate damage assessment without using any training data from the studied disaster event.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of annotation noise in point-wise supervision and propose a series of robust loss functions for different tasks. In particular, the point annotation noise includes spatial-shift noise, missing-point noise, and duplicate-point noise. The spatial-shift noise is the most common one, and exists in crowd counting, pose estimation, visual tracking, etc, while the missing-point and duplicate-point noises usually appear in dense annotations, such as crowd counting. In this paper, we first consider the shift noise by modeling the real locations as random variables and the annotated points as noisy observations. The probability density function of the intermediate representation (a smooth heat map generated from dot annotations) is derived and the negative log likelihood is used as the loss function to naturally model the shift uncertainty in the intermediate representation. The missing and duplicate noise are further modeled by an empirical way with the assumption that the noise appears at high density region with a high probability.

In this sense, our article proposes first artificial intelligence approach for Robbery Behavior Potential (RBP) prediction and detection in an indoor camera. Our method is based on three detection modules including head cover, crowd and loitering detection modules for timely actions and preventing robbery. The two first modules are implemented by retraining YOLOV5 model with our gathered dataset which is annotated manually. In addition, we innovate a novel definition for loitering detection module which is based on DeepSORT algorithm. A fuzzy inference machine renders an expert knowledge as rules and then makes final decision about predicted robbery potential. This is laborious due to: different manner of robber, different angle of surveillance camera and low resolution of video images. We accomplished our experiment on real world video surveillance images and reaching the F1-score of 0.537. Hence, to make an experimental comparison with the other related works, we define threshold value for RBP to evaluate video images as a robbery detection problem. Under this assumption, the experimental results show that the proposed method performs significantly better in detecting the robbery as compared to the robbery detection methods by distinctly report with F1-score of 0.607. We strongly believe that the application of the proposed method could cause reduction of robbery detriment in a control center of surveillance cameras by predicting and preventing incident of robbery.

Although a large variety of methods have been proposed in the literature, segmenting generic objects is still challenging because different methods often perform well in different situations, and no single method can outperform the others in all cases. To address this, we propose to solve the problem of UVOS in a crowd-sourcing setting. We claim that one can achieve superior results by aggregating the predictions of multiple imperfect methods in a reasonable way. Specifically, we propose a latent regression algorithm for ensemble-based segmentation by jointly labelling pixels in a sequence and learning an adaptive weight for each single method in an ensemble. The pixel labellings offer the outcome (pseudo groundtruth) for regression and thus promote the procedure of weight learning, while the learnt weights could provide better shape priors for labelling, resulting in more accurate segmentation. Besides, Laplacian regularization is introduced into the regression to facilitate a stable learning of the weights. The most distinct feature of our algorithm is that it adaptively learns the contributions of different single methods for each test sequence, thus is capable of capturing the advantages of those methods while avoiding their weaknesses. In the experiments, our algorithm is built on 14 non-deep learning segmentation methods which are based on handcrafted features and require no training data. Experimental results on popular benchmarks show that our algorithm achieves compelling performance, even in comparison with deep learning-based methods. Furthermore, benefiting from the adaptive weight learning mechanism, our algorithm can achieve good flexibility and usability by choosing the most complementary single methods without losing too much performance.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2971964,National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61273273); National Key Research and Development Plan of China(grant numbers:2017YFC0112001); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8985334,Video object segmentation;latent regression;appearance modelling;unsupervised,Object segmentation;Task analysis;Motion segmentation;Training data;Optical imaging;Tracking;Shape,,2,,71,CCBY,6-Feb-20

These behaviors have been well investigated by plenty of studies, while it is hard to be fully expressed by hand-craft rules. Recent studies based on LSTM networks have shown great ability to learn social behaviors. However, many of these methods rely on previous neighboring hidden states but ignore the important current intention of the neighbors. In order to address this issue, we propose a data-driven state refinement module for LSTM network (SR-LSTM), which activates the utilization of the current intention of neighbors, and jointly and iteratively refines the current states of all participants in the crowd through a message passing mechanism. To effectively extract the social effect of neighbors, we further introduce a social-aware information selection mechanism consisting of an element-wise motion gate and a pedestrian-wise attention to select useful message from neighboring pedestrians. Experimental results on two public datasets, i.e. ETH and UCY, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SR-LSTM and we achieve state-of-the-art results.",2575-7075,978-1-7281-3293-8,10.1109/CVPR.2019.01236,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8954402,Motion and Tracking;Deep Learning,,,295,,55,IEEE,9-Jan-20

Still, it is challenging in such cases as moving vehicles fast, font on number plate, illumination, etc. This led to developing efficient and automatic number plate detection as the solution. This paper presents automatic number plate detection with number diagnosis and tracking by applying various methods such as thresholding, morphological methods, contour detection, etc. Later, KNN is used for classification to improve accuracy.

Compared to a single camera, multicameras provide larger field-of-view and more object cues, and the related applications are multiview counting, multiview tracking, 3-D pose estimation or 3-D reconstruction, and so on. It is usually assumed that the cameras are all temporally synchronized when designing models for these multicamera-based tasks. However, this assumption is not always valid, especially for multicamera systems with network transmission delay and low frame rates due to limited network bandwidth, resulting in desynchronization of the captured frames across cameras. To handle the issue of unsynchronized multicameras, in this article, we propose a synchronization model that works in conjunction with existing deep neural network (DNN)-based multiview models, thus avoiding the redesign of the whole model. We consider two variants of the model, based on where in the pipeline the synchronization occurs, scene-level synchronization and camera-level synchronization. The view synchronization step and the task-specific view fusion and prediction step are unified in the same framework and trained in an end-to-end fashion. Our view synchronization models are applied to different DNNs-based multicamera vision tasks under the unsynchronized setting, including multiview counting and 3-D pose estimation, and achieve good performance compared to baselines.",2162-2388,,10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3170642,"Research Grant Council of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), China(grant numbers:TR32-101/15-R,CityU 11212518,CityU SRG 7005665,GRF CityU 11215820); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9775149,Crowd counting;deep learning;image matching;pose estimation;surveillance,Synchronization;Cameras;Task analysis;Pose estimation;Computational modeling;Surveillance;Geometry;Crowdsourcing;Image matching,,1,,57,IEEE,16-May-22

Our approach models these interactions and constraints jointly within a novel Multi-Agent Tensor Fusion (MATF) network. Specifically, the model encodes multiple agents' past trajectories and the scene context into a Multi-Agent Tensor, then applies convolutional fusion to capture multiagent interactions while retaining the spatial structure of agents and the scene context.

In the model given here (overall generality-accuracy-fast response time), CNN serves as a space feature extractor, while LSTM is used to learn time-related relationships. Due to the large number of devices that can record video from camera systems, like those used in surveillance systems, body-worn webcams, and phones, it has become hard to keep track of video footage from many surveillance devices. Using crowd-based video footage, we analyzes and alerts possible those who are affected by violent material is found in the clip. Keeping an eye on huge crowds during social gatherings, especially those where there is a possibility of violence becomes very difficult. The speed, accuracy, and generality of violent event detectors across a variety of video sources and formats are all factors that go into determining their usefulness. Intelligent monitoring technology has been extensively deployed in the nation in recent years to continually support the development of a safe city. Behavioral intelligence analysis is becoming more popular in the realm of intelligent image analysis. Currently, complex activities such as fighting or violence are rarely studied in behavior analysis techniques; instead, they focus on basic movements such as running or leaping.

Knowledge on the impacts of plastics in all forms on the planetary life-support system is rapidly accumulating and it underlines the scale of the risk humanity is taking. While quantitative information on production and use of plastics is to a large extent available, the fate of plastics discarded or leaked into the environment is highly uncertain. In particular, knowledge of how much plastic at different scales down to micro and nano levels reaches the ocean and the trajectories of the plastic in the ocean remain poorly known. Based on the mounting evidence, the United Nations have recognized the threat and are coordinating the many efforts to limit the amount of plastic that enters the environment uncontrolled. However, the Earth observation community so far has not managed to establish a global tracking and information system that would provide quantitative information on where and how plastics move in the ocean and allow the identification of the points where marine plastic pollution could be reduced most effectively. There are a number of independent projects focused on better monitoring plastics in the environment, including the ocean. In particular, projects in the EU, USA, and Japan have participated in working groups initiated by UN Environment. These projects are focusing on the monitoring of marine litter and plastics, management of information and knowledge, risks assessments, exploitation of opportunities and synergies, and, as far as possible, estimation of relevant costs and benefits. Measurements proposed include satellite and airborne remote sensing, surface and underwater in situ measurements, and crowd-sourcing observations. The need for extensive data processing and the use of deep learning techniques is acknowledged. The sensors considered range from multi- and hyperspectral sensing or other optical sensing to radar imaging aiming at a wide geo-spatial coverage. There is a need to develop global coordination mechanisms to ensure that societal knowledge needs are met and decisions on reducing plastic pollution in the ocean are informed by this knowledge.

Personal sensitive information may be included in a photo and video, and representative data that can identify an individual is face. So, various face de-identification methods have been proposed. However, most face de-identification methods have tried to obfuscate every face in an image or video and tend to focus on minimizing the loss of facial features due to obfuscation for utilizing the rest of facial features as data except for features that can identify individuals. Therefore, those methods are not adequate for face de-identification in social media service because main characters' faces like media producers, creators or actors need to be exposed on purpose, whereas the other targets' faces like pedestrians or crowd should not be exposed in the videos. Selectively obfuscating targets' faces by classifying all faces in the video into exposing targets and obfuscating targets is necessary for improving the privacy in social media service. In this paper, we propose a selective face de-identification system that exposes main characters' faces and obfuscates the other targets' faces by recognizing and classifying all faces appeared in a video. Our system detects and tracks multiple faces using a deep learning-based face recognition, and classifies main characters' faces and the obfuscating targets' faces, and finally de-identifies only the faces of the obfuscating targets on purpose.

However, they rely heavily on initial imitation learning and colossal positive datasets. Moreover, the difficulties in accurately localizing robots, detecting and tracking humans, representing and generalizing reciprocal human relationships restrict their deployment in real-world problems. We propose a Dreamer-based motion planner for collision-free navigation in diverse pedestrian scenarios. Our RL framework can completely learn from zero experience via a model-based DRL. The robot and humans are first projected onto a map, which is subsequently decoded into low-dimensional latent state. A predictive dynamic model in the latent space is jointly created to efficiently optimize the navigation policy. Additionally, we leverage the techniques of system identification, domain randomization, clustering and LiDAR SLAM for practical deployment.

These techniques are mostly used to re-identify faces or persons but in this paper we investigate the possibility to adapt these to also re-identify similar looking objects such as diamonds. Since polished diamonds are very similar to the naked eye, it is difficult to distinguish one diamond from another. We have indications that diamonds are sometimes switched by trained switchers with fake or less expensive stones, while they pretend to inspect the stone. A solution to this is diamond fingerprinting. We therefore propose a technique to generate a unique ID for each stone, which allows to re-identify the diamond solely based on an image of the gem. Since each diamond is assigned a unique ID it is even possible to keep track of the diamonds over time. This allows the seller to verify his stones before and after trading while switchers don't stand a chance.

However, current crowd evacuation models either ignore the leadership characteristics of pedestrians or predefine an invariable leader identity. This article clearly distinguishes leaders from followers in a crowd and evaluates the impact of the leader's role on crowd evacuation under dynamic situations. First, the leadership model of the pedestrian is built based on the classic OCEAN personality parameters. Social dominance tendency is measured for more credibility. Then, the dynamic leader role model (DLRM) is proposed to describe the relationship between leaders and followers, considering the interaction among pedestrians during the evacuation. Finally, a novel crowd simulation algorithm based on the above DLRM is presented using the extended social force model. Various experiments in several typical scenarios verified that our proposed simulation model has better realism.",,

Changes in climate affect meadow ecology on multiple levels, for example, by altering growing season dynamics. Tracking the effects of climate change on meadow diversity through the impacts on individual species and overall growing season dynamics is critical to conservation efforts. Here, we explore how to combine crowd-sourced camera images with machine learning to quantify flowering species richness across a range of elevations in alpine meadows located in Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington, USA. We employed three machine-learning techniques (Mask R-CNN, RetinaNet and YOLOv5) to detect wildflower species in images taken during two flowering seasons. We demonstrate that deep learning techniques can detect multiple species, providing information on flowering richness in photographed meadows. The results indicate higher richness just above the tree line for most of the species, which is comparable with patterns found using field studies. We found that the two-stage detector Mask R-CNN was more accurate than single-stage detectors like RetinaNet and YOLO, with the Mask R-CNN network performing best overall with mean average precision (mAP) of 0.67 followed by RetinaNet (0.5) and YOLO (0.4). We found that across the methods using anchor box variations in multiples of 16 led to enhanced accuracy. We also show that detection is possible even when pictures are interspersed with complex backgrounds and are not in focus. We found differential detection rates depending on species abundance, with additional challenges related to similarity in flower characteristics, labeling errors and occlusion issues. Despite these potential biases and limitations in capturing flowering abundance and location-specific quantification, accuracy was notable considering the complexity of flower types and picture angles in this dataset. We, therefore, expect that this approach can be used to address many ecological questions that benefit from automated flower detection, including studies of flowering phenology and floral resources, and that this approach can, therefore, complement a wide range of ecological approaches (e.g., field observations, experiments, community science, etc.). In all, our study suggests that ecological metrics like floral richness can be efficiently monitored by combining machine learning with easily accessible publicly curated datasets (e.g., Flickr, iNaturalist).",,

Human behaviour recognition usually seeks to automatically analyse ongoing movements and actions in different camera views by using various machine learning methodologies in unknown video clips or image sequences. Compared to other data modalities such as documents and images, processing video data demands much higher computational and storage resources. The idea of using middle level semantic concepts to represent human actions from videos is explored and it is argued that these semantic attributes enable the construction of more descriptive methods for human action recognition. The mid-level attributes, initialized by a cluster processing, are built upon low level features and fully utilize the discrepancies in different action classes, which can capture the importance of each attribute for each action class. In this way, the representation is constructed to be semantically rich and capable of highly discriminative performance even paired with simple linear classifiers. The method is verified on three challenging datasets (KTH, UCF50 and HMDB51), and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves better results than the baseline methods on human action recognition.",,

This study, for the first time, introduces a quadratic programming (QP) model with the network flow constraints to improve the accuracy of crowd counting. Firstly, the foreground of each frame is segmented into groups, each of which contains several pedestrians. Then, a regression-based map is developed in accordance with the relationship between low-level features of each group and the number of people in it. Secondly, a directed graph is constructed to simulate constraints on people's flow, whose vertices represent groups of each frame and arcs represent people moving from one group to another. Finally, by solving a QP problem with network flow constraints in the directed graph, the authors obtain consistency in people counting. The experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the crowd counting errors and improve the accuracy. Moreover, this method can also be applied to any ultramodern group-based regression counting approach to get improvements.",,

We use the term CAD-AI to refer to this expanded clinical decision support environment that uses traditional and DL-based AI methods. Numerous studies have been published to date on the development of machine learning tools for computer-aided, or AI-assisted, clinical tasks. However, most of these machine learning models are not ready for clinical deployment. It is of paramount importance to ensure that a clinical decision support tool undergoes proper training and rigorous validation of its generalizability and robustness before adoption for patient care in the clinic. To address these important issues, the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Computer-Aided Image Analysis Subcommittee (CADSC) is charged, in part, to develop recommendations on practices and standards for the development and performance assessment of computer-aided decision support systems. The committee has previously published two opinion papers on the evaluation of CAD systems and issues associated with user training and quality assurance of these systems in the clinic. With machine learning techniques continuing to evolve and CAD applications expanding to new stages of the patient care process, the current task group report considers the broader issues common to the development of most, if not all, CAD-AI applications and their translation from the bench to the clinic.

Range-based methods rely on geometric mappings to approximate a location given the calculated distances or angles from multiple reference points. In contrast, range-free strategies utilise fingerprinting, wherein an acquired fingerprint data is compared to a pre-collected dataset to identify the best position estimate. Among these, fingerprinting of channel state information (CSI) is preferred over other information such as received signal strength indicator as the former can exploit the effect of multipath propagation and is robust against non-line-of-sight channels. CSI has the potential to achieve cm-level positioning accuracy with a single reference point only. In this study, the authors survey CSI fingerprinting-based indoor positioning and mobility tracking systems. The process of fingerprinting that includes site surveying and signal preprocessing is discussed in detail.

In general, spatial diversity, such as multiple-input multiple-output antennas and wireless sensor networks, or frequency diversity (e.g. high subcarrier count, frequency hopping mechanism) are exploited to achieve high positioning resolution.

They have got a befitting medium to reach out to their targets to spread propaganda, disseminate training content, operate virtually, and further their goals. To restrain such activities, information over the internet in context of terrorism needs to be analyzed to channel it to appropriate measures in combating terrorism. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) accounts for a felicitous solution to this problem, which is an emerging discipline of leveraging publicly accessible sources of information over the internet by effectively utilizing it to extract intelligence. The process of OSINT extraction is broadly observed to be in three phases (i) Data Acquisition, (ii) Data Enrichment, and (iii) Knowledge Inference. In the context of terrorism, researchers have given noticeable contributions in compliance with these three phases. However, a comprehensive review that delineates these research contributions into an integrated workflow of intelligence extraction has not been found.

Unfortunately, the contributive improvement from re-ID model is hard to balance the accuracy and efficiency for the whole framework.

Migratory birds are among the most well-studied animals on Earth, yet relatively little is known about in-flight behaviour during nocturnal migration. Because many migrating bird species vocalize during flight, passive acoustic monitoring shows great promise for facilitating widespread monitoring of bird migration. Here, we present Nighthawk, a deep learning model designed to detect and identify the vocalizations of nocturnally migrating birds. We trained Nighthawk on the in-flight vocalizations of migratory birds using a diverse dataset of recordings from across the Americas. Our results demonstrate that Nighthawk performs well as a nocturnal flight call detector and classifier for dozens of avian taxa, both at the species level and for broader taxonomic groups (e.g. orders and families). It achieves an average precision score above 0.80 for 50 species and a mean average precision of 0.96 across 4 orders. The model accurately quantified nightly nocturnal migration intensity (80% variation explained) and species phenology (78% variation explained) and performed well on data from across North America. Incorporating modest amounts of additional annotated audio (50â€“120â€‰h) into model training yielded high performance on target datasets from both North and South America (average precision on order Passeriformes >0.99). By monitoring the vocalizations of actively migrating birds, Nighthawk provides a detailed window onto nocturnal bird migration that is not presently attainable by other means (e.g. radar or citizen science). Scientists, managers and practitioners could use acoustic monitoring with Nighthawk for a number of applications, including: monitoring migration passage at wind farms; studying airspace usage during migratory flights; monitoring the changing migrations of species susceptible to climate change; and revealing previously unknown migration routes and behaviours. Overall, this work will empower diverse stakeholders to efficiently monitor migrating birds across the Western Hemisphere and collect data in aid of science and conservation.",,

Furthermore, object detection for high-resolution videos derived from ubiquitous surveillance cameras draws many researchers' attention due to its practical significance and the challenge on detecting accuracy and speed. Existing object detection methods mainly resize and compress each frame in the video and then apply the detection algorithm, but with the method, the detection for small objects in dense scenes is far from satisfactory in terms of accuracy because small objects are reduced to pixel-level sizes in compressed frame images. In order to fix this issue, we propose AROD, a parallel detection framework based on adaptive image cropping. Unlike the traditional first-compression-and-then-detection methods, AROD adopts adaptive image cropping for distributed parallel detection. In this way, AROD significantly improves the accuracy of small object detection in dense scenes with acceptable overhead.

However, it is vulnerable to face presentation attacks by printed photos, videos, and 3D masks of real human faces. Although numerous detection techniques based on deep learning have been employed to address the problem of face presentation attacks, there are still several weaknesses in these approaches, such as high algorithm complexity and a lack of detection ability. To overcome these weaknesses, a method based on a multilevel fusion network with Laplacian embedding (MFNet-LE) for the detection of face presentation attacks is proposed. First, a shallow network that contains just three layers was developed, which makes the model faster. Then, an optimised multilevel fusion strategy was developed to combine the input with the output of all previous layers to improve the detection ability of the method. Finally, a Laplacian embedding algorithm is introduced to maintain the inter-class discrimination and penalise the intra-class distance. Under the joint supervision of Laplacian loss and softmax loss, the proposed approach can obtain more discriminative features, which enhance the accuracy of attack detection. Experiments were conducted with three public databases for face presentation attacks: CASIA FASD, Idiap Replay Attack database and MSU USSA.

An interesting question is: can these models well solve real-world problems with similar settings (e.g., identical input/output) to the benchmark datasets? We argue that a model is trained to answer the same information need in a similar context (e.g., the information available), for which the training dataset is created. The trained model may be used to solve real-world problems for a similar information need in a similar context. However, information need is independent of the format of dataset input/output. Although some datasets may share high structural similarities, they may represent different research tasks aiming for answering different information needs. Examples are questionâ€“answer pairs for the question answering (QA) task, and image-caption pairs for the image captioning (IC) task. In this paper, we use the QA task and IC task as two case studies and compare their widely used benchmark datasets. From the perspective of information need in the context of information retrieval, we show the differences in the dataset creation processes and the differences in morphosyntactic properties between datasets. The differences in these datasets can be attributed to the different information needs and contexts of the specific research tasks. We encourage all researchers to consider the information need perspective of a research task when selecting the appropriate datasets to train a model. Likewise, while creating a dataset, researchers may also incorporate the information need perspective as a factor to determine the degree to which the dataset accurately reflects the real-world problem or the research task they intend to tackle.",,

The first step uses the improved YOLOv5 detector to detect motorcycles (including motorcyclists) from video surveillance. The second step takes the motorcycles detected in the previous step as input and continues to use the improved YOLOv5 detector to detect whether the motorcyclists wear helmets.

With the amount of large data available, these computer algorithms are ever increasing in numerous fields, although there is ongoing scepticism and scholars still question the actual impact and deliverables of algorithms. This study aims to provide a systematic review of the state-of-the-art ML-based techniques, trends, opportunities and challenges in river research by applying text mining and automated content analysis. Unsupervised and supervised learning have dominated river research while neural networks and deep learning have also gradually gained popularity. Matrix factorisation and linear models have been the most popular ML algorithms, with around 1300 and 800 publications on these topics in 2020 respectively. In contrast, river researchers have had few applications in multiclass and multilabel algorithm, associate rule and NaÃ¯ve Bayes. The current article proposes an end-to-end workflow of ML applications in river research in order to tackle major ML challenges, including four steps: (1) data collection and preparation; (2) model evaluation and selection; (3) model application; and (4) feedback loops. Within this workflow, river modellers have to balance numerous trade-offs related to model traits, such as complexity, accuracy, interpretability, bias, data privacy and accessibility and spatial and temporal scales. Any choices made when balancing the trade-offs can lead to different model outcomes affecting the final applications. Hence, it is necessary to carefully consider and specify modelling goals, understand the data collected and maintain feedback loops in order to continuously improve model performance and eventually reach the research objectives. Moreover, it remains crucial to address the users' needs and demands that often entail additional elements, such as computational cost, development time and the quantity, quality and compatibility of data. Furthermore, river researchers should account for new technologies and regulations in data collection and protection that are transforming the development and applications of ML, most notably data warehouse and information management with multiple-cycles that are becoming a cornerstone of the integration of ML in decision-making in river and ecosystem management.",,

In particular, the recent boom in passive acoustic sensors has provided efficient, noninvasive, and taxonomically broad means to study wildlife populations and communities, and monitor their responses to environmental change. However, until recently, technological costs and constraints have largely confined research in passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) to a handful of taxonomic groups (e.g., bats, cetaceans, birds), often in relatively small-scale, proof-of-concept studies. The arrival of low-cost, open-source sensors is now rapidly expanding access to PAM technologies, making it vital to evaluate where these tools can contribute to broader efforts in ecology and biodiversity research. Here, we synthesise and critically assess the current emerging opportunities and challenges for PAM for ecological assessment and monitoring of both species populations and communities. We show that terrestrial and marine PAM applications are advancing rapidly, facilitated by emerging sensor hardware, the application of machine learning innovations to automated wildlife call identification, and work towards developing acoustic biodiversity indicators. However, the broader scope of PAM research remains constrained by limited availability of reference sound libraries and open-source audio processing tools, especially for the tropics, and lack of clarity around the accuracy, transferability and limitations of many analytical methods. In order to improve possibilities for PAM globally, we emphasise the need for collaborative work to develop standardised survey and analysis protocols, publicly archived sound libraries, multiyear audio datasets, and a more robust theoretical and analytical framework for monitoring vocalising animal communities.",,

The efficient detection of crowd dynamics in urban open spaces using multi-viewpoint surveillance videos continues to be a fundamental problem in the field of urban security. The use of existing methods for extracting features from video images has resulted in significant progress in single-camera image space. However, surveillance videos are geotagged videos with location information, and few studies have fully exploited the spatial semantics of these videos. In this study, multi-viewpoint videos in geographic space are used to fuse object trajectories for crowd sensing and spatiotemporal analysis. The YOLOv3-DeepSORT model is used to detect a pedestrian and extract the corresponding image coordinates, combine spatial semantics (such as the positions of the pedestrian in the field of view of the camera) to build a projection transformation matrix and map the object recorded by a single camera to geographic space. Trajectories from multi-viewpoint videos are fused based on the features of location, time, and directions to generate a complete pedestrian trajectory. Then, crowd spatial pattern analysis, density estimation, and motion trend analysis are performed.

Although supervised learning has achieved great success in many tasks, sufficient data supervision for labels is not accessible in many domains because accurate data labelling is costly and laborious, particularly in medical image analysis. The cost of the dataset with ground-truth labels is much higher than in other domains. Therefore, it is noteworthy to focus on weakly supervised learning for medical image analysis, as it is more applicable for practical applications. In this review, the authors give an overview of the latest process of weakly supervised learning in medical image analysis, including incomplete, inexact, and inaccurate supervision, and introduce the related works on different applications for medical image analysis. Related concepts are illustrated to help readers get an overview ranging from supervised to unsupervised learning within the scope of machine learning.

The question we address here is whether such crowd-sourced data contain substantial macroecological information. In particular, we aim to understand if we can detect known environmental gradients shaping plant co-occurrences. In this study we analysed 1 million data points collected through the use of the mobile app Flora Incognita between 2018 and 2019 in Germany and compared them with Florkart, containing plant occurrence data collected by more than 5000 floristic experts over a 70-year period. The direct comparison of the two data sets reveals that the crowd-sourced data particularly undersample areas of low population density. However, using nonlinear dimensionality reduction we were able to uncover macroecological patterns in both data sets that correspond well to each other. Mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality and wind dynamics as well as soil water content and soil texture represent the most important gradients shaping species composition in both data collections. Our analysis describes one way of how automated species identification could soon enable near real-time monitoring of macroecological patterns and their changes, but also discusses biases that must be carefully considered before crowd-sourced biodiversity data can effectively guide conservation measures.",,

The OTMS generates a tunable magnetic field and induces movement in magnetic cells that are subsequently analyzed through a learning-based tracking-by-detection system. The magnetic moment of numerous cells can be calculated simultaneously, thereby providing a quantitative tool to assess cellular magnetic properties within populations. Upon deploying the OTMS, a stable population of magnetic cells in human peripheral monocytes is discovered. Further application in the analysis of clinical blood samples reveals an intriguing pattern: the proportion of magnetic monocytes differs significantly between systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and healthy volunteers. This variation is positively correlated with disease activity, a trend not observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

This paper exploits background subtraction (BS), convolutional autoencoder, and object detection for a fully automated surveillance system. BS was performed by modelling each pixel as a mixture of Gaussians (MoG) to concatenate only the higher-order learning in the foreground. Next, the foreground objects are fed to the convolutional autoencoders to filter out abnormal events from normal ones and automatically identify signs of threat and violence in real time. Then, object detection is introduced on the entire scene and the region of interest is highlighted with a bounding box to minimize human intervention in video stream processing. At recognition time, the network generates an alarm for the presence of an anomaly to notify of the identification of potentially suspicious actions. Finally, the complete system is validated upon several benchmark datasets and proved to be robust for complex video anomaly detection.

With the lack of availability of vaccines, there is an urgent need to avert resurgence of infections by putting some measures, such as contact tracing, in place. While digital tools, such as phone applications are advantageous, they also pose challenges and have limitations (eg, wireless coverage could be an issue in some cases). On the other hand, wearable devices, when coupled with the Internet of Things (IoT), are expected to influence lifestyle and healthcare directly, and they may be useful for health monitoring during the global pandemic and beyond. In this work, we conduct a literature review of contact tracing methods and applications. Based on the literature review, we found limitations in gathering health data, such as insufficient network coverage. To address these shortcomings, we propose a novel intelligent tool that will be useful for contact tracing and prediction of COVID-19 clusters. The solution comprises a phone application combined with a wearable device, infused with unique intelligent IoT features (complex data analysis and intelligent data visualization) embedded within the system to aid in COVID-19 analysis. Contact tracing applications must establish data collection and data interpretation. Intelligent data interpretation can assist epidemiological scientists in anticipating clusters, and can enable them to take necessary action in improving public health management.

For this reason, we transform the bone-maturity-level classification problem into the similarity matching problem. Also, we propose a general structure based on Siamese network by merging two inputs into a two-channel input and introducing a dual attention mechanism, to create an Attentional Two-Channel Network (ATC-Net).

However, it remains a challenging task because the existing methods, such as traditional tracking method, discrimination method based on footprint identification, and molecular biology method, are invasive, inaccurate, expensive, or challenging to perform. The advances of imaging technologies have led to the wide applications of digital images and videos in panda conservation and management, which makes it possible for individual panda recognition in a noninvasive manner by using image-based panda face recognition method. In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. For panda face recognition, a fully automatic deep learning algorithm which consists of a sequence of deep neural networks (DNNs) used for panda face detection, segmentation, alignment, and identity prediction is developed in this study. To develop and evaluate the algorithm, the largest panda image dataset containing 6,441 images from 218 different pandas, which is 39.78% of captive pandas in the world, is established. The algorithm achieved 96.27% accuracy in panda recognition and 100% accuracy in detection. This study shows that panda faces can be used for panda recognition.

Second, they review deep network structures in these methods, and detail the usage and training of these networks for multi-object tracking problem. Through experimental comparison of tracking results in the benchmarks in total and by group, they finally show the effectiveness of deep networks for tracking employed in different manners, and compare the advantages of these networks and their robustness under different tracking conditions. Moreover, they analyse the limitations of current methods, and draw some useful conclusions to facilitate the exploration of new directions for multi-object tracking.",,

Still and video camera surveillance can generate enormous quantities of data, which is laborious and expensive to screen for the species of interest. In the present study, we describe a state-of-the-art, deep learning approach for automatically identifying and isolating species-specific activity from still images and video data. We used a dataset consisting of 8,368 images of wild and domestic animals in farm buildings, and we developed an approach firstly to distinguish badgers from other species (binary classification) and secondly to distinguish each of six animal species (multiclassification). We focused on binary classification of badgers first because such a tool would be relevant to efforts to manage Mycobacterium bovis (the cause of bovine tuberculosis) transmission between badgers and cattle. We used two deep learning frameworks for automatic image recognition. They achieved high accuracies, in the order of 98.05% for binary classification and 90.32% for multiclassification. Based on the deep learning framework, a detection process was also developed for identifying animals of interest in video footage, which to our knowledge is the first application for this purpose. The algorithms developed here have wide applications in wildlife monitoring where large quantities of visual data require screening for certain species.",,

It is also gaining popularity in biology, where it has been used for automated species identification, environmental monitoring, ecological modelling, behavioural studies, DNA sequencing and population genetics and phylogenetics, among other applications. Deep learning relies on artificial neural networks for predictive modelling and excels at recognizing complex patterns. In this review we synthesize 818 studies using deep learning in the context of ecology and evolution to give a discipline-wide perspective necessary to promote a rethinking of inference approaches in the field. We provide an introduction to machine learning and contrast it with mechanistic inference, followed by a gentle primer on deep learning. We review the applications of deep learning in ecology and evolution and discuss its limitations and efforts to overcome them. We also provide a practical primer for biologists interested in including deep learning in their toolkit and identify its possible future applications. We find that deep learning is being rapidly adopted in ecology and evolution, with 589 studies (64%) published since the beginning of 2019. Most use convolutional neural networks (496 studies) and supervised learning for image identification but also for tasks using molecular data, sounds, environmental data or video as input. More sophisticated uses of deep learning in biology are also beginning to appear. Operating within the machine learning paradigm, deep learning can be viewed as an alternative to mechanistic modelling. It has desirable properties of good performance and scaling with increasing complexity, while posing unique challenges such as sensitivity to bias in input data. We expect that rapid adoption of deep learning in ecology and evolution will continue, especially in automation of biodiversity monitoring and discovery and inference from genetic data. Increased use of unsupervised learning for discovery and visualization of clusters and gaps, simplification of multi-step analysis pipelines, and integration of machine learning into graduate and postgraduate training are all likely in the near future.",,

The efficiency of the system is affected by real-time processing and the error rate of detection. These concerns have not been completely addressed in previous studies. Therefore, this study proposes a real-time pedestrian recognition system that ensures high accuracy by using a deep learning classifier and zebra-crossing recognition techniques. The proposed system was designed to improve pedestrian safety and reduce accidents at intersections. Environmental feature vectors were first used to detect zebra crossings and to determine crossing areas. An adaptive mapping technique was then used to map the pedestrian waiting area based on the crossing area. A dual camera mechanism was used to maintain detection accuracy and improve system fault tolerance. Finally, the you-only-look-once model was used to recognize pedestrians at intersections. A system prototype was implemented to verify the feasibility of the proposed system.

Importantly, it allows us to quantify passerine bird migration at different scales. Yet, no algorithm to detect soaring bird flocks in weather radar is available, precluding our ability to study this type of migration over large spatial scales. We developed the first automatic algorithm for detecting the migration of flocks of soaring birds, an important bio-flow phenomenon involving many millions of birds that travel across large spatial extents, with implications for risk of bird-aircraft collisions. The algorithm was developed with a deep learning network for semantic segmentation using U-Net architecture. We tested several models with different weather radar products and with image sequences for flock movement identification. The best model includes the radial velocity product and a sequence of two previous images. It identifies 93% of soaring bird flocks that were tagged by a human on the radar image, with a false discovery of less than 20%. Large birds such as those detected by the algorithm pose a serious risk for flight safety of civilian and military transportation and therefore the application of this algorithm can substantially reduce bird-strikes, leading to reduced financial losses and threats to human lives. In addition, it can help overcome one of the main challenges in the study of bird migration by automatically and continuously detecting flocks of large birds over wide spatial scales without the need to equip the birds with tracking devices, unravelling the abundance, timing, spatial flyways, seasonal trends and influences of environmental conditions on the migration of bird flocks.",,

Crowd counting has significant social and economic value and is a major focus in artificial intelligence. Despite many advancements in this field, many of them are not widely known, especially in terms of research data. The authors proposed a three-tier standardised dataset taxonomy (TSDT). The Taxonomy divides datasets into small-scale, large-scale and hyper-scale, according to different application scenarios. This theory can help researchers make more efficient use of datasets and improve the performance of AI algorithms in specific fields. Additionally, the authors proposed a new evaluation index for the clarity of the dataset: average pixel occupied by each object (APO). This new evaluation index is more suitable for evaluating the clarity of the dataset in the object counting task than the image resolution. Moreover, the authors classified the crowd counting methods from a data-driven perspective: multi-scale networks, single-column networks, multi-column networks, multi-task networks, attention networks and weak-supervised networks and introduced the classic crowd counting methods of each class. The authors classified the existing 36 datasets according to the theory of three-tier standardised dataset taxonomy and discussed and evaluated these datasets. The authors evaluated the performance of more than 100 methods in the past five years on different levels of popular datasets. Recently, progress in research on small-scale datasets has slowed down. There are few new datasets and algorithms on small-scale datasets. The studies focused on large or hyper-scale datasets appear to be reaching a saturation point.

However, it is usually time-consuming and easily subjected to intra-observer and inter-observer variability. So far, few studies have been explored to directly predict iGTV by deep learning technique, because the iGTV contains not only the gross target volume (GTV) but also the motion information of the GTV. Purpose This work was an exploratory study to present a deep learning-based framework to segment iGTV rapidly and accurately in 4D CT images for lung cancers. Methods Five models, including 3D UNet, mmUNet with point-wise add merging approach (mmUNet-add), mmUNet with concatenate fusion strategy (mmUNet-cat), gruUNet with point-wise add fusion approach (gruUNet-add), and gruUNet with concatenate method (gruUNet-cat), were adopted for iGTV segmentation. All the models originated from the 3D UNet network, with multi-channel multi-path and convolutional gated recurrent unit (GRU) added in the mmUNet and gruUNet networks, respectively. Seventy patients with lung cancers were collected and 55 cases were randomly selected as the training set, and 15 cases as the testing set. In addition, the segmentation results of the five models were compared with the ground truths qualitatively and quantitatively. Results In terms of Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), the proposed four networks (mmUNet-add, mmUNet-cat, gruUNet-add, and gruUNet-cat) increased the DSC score of 3D UNet from 0.6945 to 0.7342, 0.7253, 0.7405, and 0.7365, respectively. However, the differences were not statistically significant (p > 0.05). After a simple post-processing to remove the small isolated connected regions, the mean 95th percentile Hausdorff distances (HD_95s) of the 3D UNet, mmUNet-add, mmUNet-cat, gruUNet-add, and gruUNet-cat networks were 19.70, 15.75, 15.84, 15.61, and 15.83 mm, respectively, corresponding to 25.35, 25.96, 25.11, 28.23, and 24.47 mm before the post-processing. With regard to runtime, significant elapsed time growths (about 70s and 230s) were observed both in the mmUNet and gruUNet architectures due to the increasing parameters. But the mmUNet structure showed less growth. Conclusion Our study demonstrated the ability of the deep learning technique to predict iGTVs directly. With the introduction of multi-channel multi-path and convolutional GRU, the segmentation accuracy was improved under certain conditions with a reduced segmentation efficiency and a further research topic when the 3D UNet network would lead to poor performance is elicited. Less efficiency degradation was observed in the mmUNet structure. Besides, the element-wise add fusing strategy was favorable to increase DSC, whereas HD_95 benefited from the concentrate merging approach. Nevertheless, the segmentation accuracy by deep learning still remains to be improved.",,

This study generated a dataset including over 150,000 maize and sorghum images for leaf counting projects. A subset of 17,783 images also includes annotations of the positions of individual leaf tips. With these annotated images, we evaluate two deep learning-based approaches for automated leaf counting: the first based on counting-by-regression from whole image analysis and a second based on counting-by-detection. Both approaches can achieve root of mean square error (RMSE) smaller than one leaf, only moderately inferior to the RMSE between human annotators of between 0.57 and 0.73 leaves.

AngleCam is based on pattern recognition with convolutional neural networks and trained with leaf angle distributions obtained from visual interpretation of more than 2500 plant photographs across different species and scene conditions. Leaf angle predictions were evaluated over a wide range of species and scene conditions using independent samples from visual interpretation (R2Â =Â 0.84) and compared to leaf angle estimates obtained from terrestrial laser scanning (R2Â =Â 0.75). AngleCam was tested for the long-term monitoring of leaf angles for two broadleaf tree species in a temperate forest. The plausibility of the predicted leaf angle time series was underlined by its close relationship with environmental variables related to transpiration. The evaluations confirm that AngleCam is a robust and efficient method to track leaf angles under field conditions.

The result is driven by a larger share of tweets discussing immigrants and Muslims, common AfD topics, and by a more negative sentiment of these tweets. Shifts in language similarity are correlated with changes in vote shares between federal elections. These results point to the role of perceived threats from minorities on the success of nationalist parties.",,

Research in leadership and decision-making suggests that the physical characteristics and traits of an individual influence the consumer's trustworthiness. Despite being a less explored research area, studying the impact of specific verbal and non-verbal cues of a political leader through a technological lens, such as eye-tracking has been sparsely talked about. Three sets of experiments were conducted to study voters' visual attention and reactions to gage their willingness to vote. First, an eye-tracking tool was used to record the visual attention and regions of interest (ROI) of voters. Subsequently, a short survey was used to analyze the â€œwillingness to voteâ€, followed by a pilot study on their attention to non-verbal cues from the candidate. Also, a sentiment analysis of the voters was gathered from social media platforms. The present study analyzed the non-verbal aspects of a political leader with regard to voting intention and found that even a few of the non-verbal cues have an influence on the willingness to vote for a candidate. The findings contribute to the literature of neuro-politics and decision-making by analyzing voters' experiences of two political leaders, Narendra Modi (NaMo) and Rahul Gandhi (RaGa) based on non-verbal cues. Political parties and candidates should focus on non-verbal cues to increase their chances of winning elections. In addition, practitioners from the industry should incorporate appropriate non-verbal cues while designing ad campaigns, personal branding, PR campaigns, and CEO addresses.",,

Vibration-based condition assessment has garnered as a prominent method of evaluating the health of large-scale infrastructure. The use of contact-based sensors for acquiring vibration data becomes uneconomical and tedious due to their instrumentation cost, centralized nature, and densification required to collect sufficient data for system identification of modern complex structures. A need to advance and develop alternative methods for efficient sensing system results in next-generation measurement technology of structural health monitoring. The abundance of handheld smartphones with easily programmable framework has helped in modifying relevant software to acquire vibration data using embedded sensors in the smartphone. The inexpensive cameras have been used to capture images and videos that are utilized to understand the structural behavior with the aid of advanced signal processing techniques. The inaccessible components of structures require noncontact sensors such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or so-called drones and mobile sensors to acquire structural data. To the authors' knowledge, this paper first time presents a comprehensive review of a suite of next-generation smart sensing technology that has been developed in recent years within the context of structural health monitoring.

This article explores the possibilities and opportunities of integrating cloud technology with fog and edge-based computing to provide healthcare services to users in exigency. Here, we propose an end-to-end framework named RESCUE (enabling green healthcare services using integrated iot-edge-fog-cloud computing environments), consisting efficient spatio-temporal data analytics module for efficient information sharing, spatio-temporal data analysis to predict the path for users to reach the destination (healthcare center or relief camps) with minimum delay in the time of exigency (say, natural disaster).

Our work is different from the existing literature in varied aspects: it analyses the context and semantics by augmenting real-time volunteered geographical information (VGI) and refines it. Furthermore, the novel path prediction module incorporates such VGI instances and predicts routes in emergencies avoiding all possible risks. Also, the design of development of a latency-aware, power-aware data-driven analytics system helps to resolve any spatio-temporal query more efficiently compared to the existing works for any time-critical application.

Specifically, the authors use a graph to model pedestrian walking state where nodes denote the pedestrian movement information, and edges represent the interactions between pairwise pedestrians. An end-to-end architecture that combines a sequence-to-sequence model with a graph convolutional network to learn the movement features and interaction features is used. To capture the interaction influence on different pedestrians, an emotion gate to refine the learned features and filter out useless information is introduced.

In addition, a new dataset was also built to test the proposed framework for the selective focus saliency detection.

Although interactions and cognitive engagement have attracted extensive attention in online learning environments, few studies have revealed the evolution of cognitive engagement with interaction levels. Objectives The study aims to automatically identify learners' interactions and cognitive engagement and then analyse the evolution of learners' cognitive engagement with interaction levels and during different stages of online learning. Methods The participants of the study were learners who participated in an online open course. Their text data from discussion forums on five learning themes were collected. Data were analysed using text mining and ENA. Results Learners' cognitive engagement in online learning was related to interaction levels. As learners' online interaction levels changed from surface to deep, cognitive engagement levels changed from low to high. With the continuous occurrence of deep interactions, cognitive feedback became more complex. At the socialâ€“emotional interaction level, although learners' cognitive engagement levels began to change from low to high, complex cognitive feedback was still insufficient. In addition, the analysis of the evolution of cognitive engagement during different stages of online learning showed that learners' patterns of cognitive engagement changed significantly as the learning process continued, from initially dynamic and complex to a stable development pattern.

In this study, we start by describing a solution designed for the long range wide area network (LoRaWAN) to localize position of IoT modules such as wearables used from vulnerable groups.

Routing people in need is one of the use cases the above mechanism could be integrated so as to be able to be tracked by familiar people. After that, we evaluate the usage of mathematical model of multilateration algorithms using time difference of arrival (TDoA) as a solution for positioning over LoRaWAN. The research is carried out using simulations in Python by configuring the constant positions of the Gateways inside an outdoor area. The proposed algorithms can be integrated in application for tracking people at any time and especially routing people from vulnerable groups.

In Wi-Fi positioning, the authors use a DNN to extract robust features from fluctuant Wi-Fi signals in the off-line phase, and obtain more accurate positioning results by computing posterior probabilities in online positioning. Acceleration, gyroscope, and magnetometer data are used to calculate attitude angle, step frequency, and step length, respectively. Received Wi-Fi signal strength is susceptible in complex indoor environments, and PDR errors accumulate over time. A factor-graph model with adaptive robust adjustment is proposed to fuse the positioning results of Wi-Fi and PDR, and it overcomes such shortcomings as slow update frequency and gross errors of Wi-Fi and PDR errors accumulated over time, respectively. When the absence of PDR occurs, hidden Markov model is introduced to smooth multiple DNN-based Wi-Fi positioning estimates at the unknown point to obtain the optimal solution. Experimental results show that the proposed system is more robust and has better accuracy under different motion gestures (held-in-hand, dangling, and calling).",,

Current research focuses on when people use algorithmic predictions, how people perceive algorithms, and how algorithms can be made more appealing. We also examine attempts to boost human forecasting accuracy, either by spotting talent, cultivating talent via training, or developing algorithms that aggregate individual forecasts. We hypothesize that hybrid models with both human and algorithmic predictions may encounter less resistance than algorithms alone, especially when the algorithm is â€œhumanizedâ€ (with anthropomorphic features) and the human is â€œalgorithmizedâ€ (by reducing noise, decreasing bias and increasing signal).",,

The country also implemented recursive national lockdowns and curfews to reduce the virus transmission rate and its catastrophic impact. These large-scale measures are not easy to implement, adhere to and subsequently difficult to practice and maintain which lead to imperfect public compliance, especially if there is a significant impact on social and political norms, economy, and psychological wellbeing of the affected population. Also, emerging COVID-19 variants, porous borders, regular movement of informal traders and sale of fake vaccination certificates continue to threaten impressive progress made towards virus containment. Therefore, several emerging technologies have been adopted to strengthen the health system and health services delivery, improve compliance, adherence and maintain social distancing. These technologies use health data, symptoms monitoring, mobility, location and proximity data for contact tracing, self-isolation, and quarantine compliance. However, the use of emerging technologies has been debatable and contentious because of the potential violation of ethical values such as security and privacy, data format and management, synchronization, over-tracking, over-surveillance and lack of proper development and implementation guidelines which impact their efficacy, adoption and ultimately influence public trust. Therefore, the study proposes ethical framework for using emerging technologies to contain the COVID-19 pandemic.

Therefore, in this article, a multiagent evacuation framework for complex virtual fire scenarios is proposed and effectively used to simulate a multiagent evacuation procedure to approximate the goal of fire drills in a less costly manner. Specifically, the concept of a multihierarchy agent group model is proposed; that is, the evacuation of multiple agents is separated into leader-follower and freedom modes. Additionally, several complex actions of individual humans in actual fire drills are fully considered, and a multiaction agent schema is presented to characterize the associated real effects. In addition, generative adversarial imitation learning is adopted to obtain the evacuation path of the leader-agent by training numerous learning epochs. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted to validate the feasibility of our proposed method. The results show that the proposed method is superior to other methods and that it realistically and reasonably shows the procedure of multiagent evacuation in complex fire emergency scenarios.",,

In the authorsâ€™ project, the traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) models are modified and experiments are followed as well. The model has two main contributions. First, the output shows a confidence score of how likely this box contains a car for each predicted box, which has some certain advantages compared with other models and is quite different from traditional approaches. Another contribution is the fine-grained classification of the makers and models of a car, which need to train the bounding box predictors as part of the network training.

In the context of athlete re-identification during sports event scenes, the athlete bib number is fully considered, an important clue that can provide different athletes' identities, and the traditional visual features of the person and high-level semantic information of the bib number text are fused.

Our approach does not depend on specific targets or a priori information and adapts to a wide range of variations in road appearances and camera views. We make three main contributions to automatic camera calibration. Firstly, we propose a Deep Calibration Network to estimate the vanishing point and camera extrinsic parameters from an RGB image in an end-to-end manner. The vanishing point and camera rotation angles are then used to calculate the camera focal length according to the perspective projection geometry, thus constructing the complete camera matrix. Secondly, we introduce a Multi-View Camera Calibration Dataset, which contains a total of 32,712 images for 17 expressway scenes. The dataset covers a wide range of camera views and expressway types, which is challenging. Thirdly, we present a novel Curved Reference Line System adapted to the expressway shape to locate vehicles on curved roads accurately. This coordinate system can effectively transform the vehicle coordinates from a Cartesian system to the vehicle's mileage and horizontal distance relative to the lane line. A comprehensive evaluation on Multi-View Camera Calibration Dataset shows that our technique can automatically calibrate a single camera at about 40fps on an NVIDIA GTX1060 processor and accurately locate vehicles on curved roads, making it suitable for deployment in expressway surveillance systems.",,

One of the critical issues is how to review these reports efficiently. Researchers have recently proposed clustering, classification, and prioritization techniques to solve this problem. However, existing studies directly use related technologies to text description and segment the text content without further understanding of the text content. By deeply digging into the text information and distinguishing it according to its actual meaning, the sentences described in the text can be categorized into two types: Describing abnormal system behavior and describing reproduction steps. This paper proposes a mobile crowdsourced test report prioritization technique to improve performance. First, we use a TextCNN trained on large-scale projects to distinguish the text descriptions of reports, then extract features from the text and screenshot information, respectively. Then we apply a clustering technique to gather similar reports. Finally, the inspection order is sampled from the clustering results. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on six industrial crowdsourced projects. The results show that our method can detect all bugs faster in a limited time than existing prioritization methods, which can improve the bug reports review efficiency.",,

Sentiment analysis (SA) aims to extract sentiments, emotions or opinions from texts, made available by different data sources like SNs. This review presents a depth study relative to the methods and the main tools for SA. The analysis was performed by defining four criteria and several variables to compare 24 tools with objective criteria. Specifically, the tools have been analyzed and tested to verify their usability, flexibility of use, and other specifications related to the type of analysis performed. The majority of tools can detect positive, negative, and neutral polarity, while few tools only detect positive and negative polarity. Moreover, seven tools were able to recognize emotions, and only one provides a visual map for geo-referenced data. Except for one, remaining 23 tools offer service through the web interface. Finally, only nine tools provide both application program interfaces and a client for common programming languages to allow potential developer end-users to integrate a specific SA tool into their application.

It has been studied extensively in recent years, and the attention mechanism is widely applied in person re-id. But many works mainly focus on extracting discriminative features from local saliency regions, while ignoring some potentially global information between whole-body features and body-part features. In this study, we first proposed two effective global information for extracting discriminative features: spatial topology information (STI) and channel affinity information (CAI). On this basis, we further propose a Multi-information Fusion reinforced Global Attention (MIFGA) module which can effectively fuse a variety of information and utilize more comprehensive information to guide the learning of attention, so as to obtain pedestrian features that are conducive to clustering. Specifically, the proposed MIFGA module includes spatial attention (MIFGA-S) and channel attention (MIFGA-C). MIFGA-S mainly utilizes local feature semantic information and STI to guide the learning of spatial attention. Furthermore, to mine the potential topology information in original feature maps, the self-learning graph convolution network is proposed. MIFGA-C fuses channel semantic information and CAI to guide the learning of channel attention.

Situational awareness is an essential aspect of these surveillance systems and it is inferred through underlying context aware frameworks. However, these systems may not possess the ability to proactively disseminate the real-time context among its sensor nodes. Moreover, in the specific conditions of occurrence of related or repeated events, these systems may also perform inefficiently through afresh context processing and disseminate cycles, without learning from the relevant context that has already been occurred and processed by the system. It leads to deteriorated performance, especially delay in reaction, overwhelmed processing, and energy expenditures. Therefore, to counter such issues, this research work proposes an energy efficient situational aware framework deployed in visual sensors network that is incorporated with context associative learning. System observes currently occurring context at each instance of an event. Overtime, context is refined and stored in context database. Such mechanism empowers the system to learn from previous experiences and develop relationship among the subsequent events that is embedded through this associative (adaptive) learning. Eventually, each event is processed through intelligent resource allocation, supported through mechanism of context learning that further illustrates the independent functions of reduced processing and improved (rapid) decision making resulting in evolution of energy efficient computing paradigm. Ultimately, the capability of learned reflex-action is induced through introspectively evolved context of the system in entirety and against specific condition of recurred situation depicting minimum energy expenditure.",,

This review provides an overview of existing and experimental applications of artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and internet of things as part of early warning and emerging risk identification tools and methods in the food safety domain. There is an ongoing rapid development of systems fed by numerous, real-time, and diverse data with the aim of early warning and identification of emerging food safety risks. The suitability of big data and AI to support such systems is illustrated by two cases in which climate change drives the emergence of risks, namely, harmful algal blooms affecting seafood and fungal growth and mycotoxin formation in crops. Automation and machine learning are crucial for the development of future real-time food safety risk early warning systems. Although these developments increase the feasibility and effectiveness of prospective early warning and emerging risk identification tools, their implementation may prove challenging, particularly for low- and middle-income countries due to low connectivity and data availability. It is advocated to overcome these challenges by improving the capability and capacity of national authorities, as well as by enhancing their collaboration with the private sector and international organizations.",,

The goal is to present their basic concepts and principles, including the quantification analysis procedure and its potential application scenarios. This review shows that the most common behaviour quantification indexes can be categorised into three classes: swimming indexes, physical indexes and context indexes. Typically, swimming indexes are of the most interest to researchers. However, achieving comprehensiveness of the information and quantisation precision remain challenging in fish behaviour analysis. In brief, this paper aims to help researchers and practitioners better understand the current state-of-the-art behavioural quantification analysis, which provides strong support for the implementation of intelligent breeding.",,

To fill this gap, this study proposes an automated approach, which automatically identifies requirements information using natural language processing and machine learning. For this purpose, the authors analysed 3319 user comments collected from the seven discussion topics in the Reddit forum. Then, using a content analysis approach, they studied how frequently end-users submit such information across each discussion topic. Also, they developed an automated approach that identifies key stakeholders, who frequently contribute his rationales in the forum discussion. Further, they employed different machine learning algorithms to classify user comments into rationale elements of different types. The authors' results show that online forums, such as Reddit, can be a rich source of requirements elicitation.

While crucial, the precise identification of structures serving as evolutionary traits and systematic criteria is not per se a highly motivating task for students. Teaching this in a traditional teaching setting is quite challenging especially with a large crowd of students to be kept engaged. This is even more difficult if, as during the COVID-19 crisis, students are not allowed to access laboratories for hands-on observation on fresh specimens and sometimes restricted to short-range movements outside their home. Here, we present QuoVidi, a new open-source web platform for the organization of large-scale treasure hunts. The platform works as follows: students, organized in teams, receive a list of quests that contain morphologic, ecologic, or systematic terms. They have to first understand the meaning of the quests, then go and find them in the environment. Once they find the organism corresponding to a quest, they upload a geotagged picture of their finding and submit this on the platform. The correctness of each submission is evaluated by the staff. During the COVID-19 lockdown, previously validated pictures were also submitted for evaluation to students that were locked in low-biodiversity areas. From a research perspective, the system enables the creation of large image databases by the students, similar to citizen science projects. Beside the enhanced motivation of students to learn the vocabulary and perform observations on self-found specimens, this system allows instructors to remotely follow and assess the work performed by large numbers of students. The interface is freely available, open-source and customizable. Unlike existing naturalist platforms, allows the educators to fully customize the quests of interest. This enables the creation of multiple teaching scenarios, without being bound to a fixed scope. QuoVidi can be used in other disciplines with adapted quests and we expect it to be of interest in many classroom settings.",,

The sharing of data is very important for enhancing vehicular services, but at the same time makes IoV vulnerable for security and privacy issues. The smart and interconnected vehicles produce sophisticated services for transport authorities, car manufacturers, vehicle owners, and other service providers. IoV are very vulnerable to malicious attacks due to its self-organizing nature and the open source nature of its implementations. This exposes the smart and interconnected vehicles to a variety of privacy and security threats, such as a remote hijacking or location tracking of vehicles. Thus, the security for IoV environment is critical. Blockchain technology has been recently used for cybersecurity due to the robustness and integrity preserving nature of its design. This review article provides a detailed survey of existing work in the literature to secure IoV through blockchain techniques such as security, privacy, reputation, distributed, decentralized, data sharing, authentication, and trust-based approaches.

We argue that secondary data can provide a wealth of ecologically relevant information, the utilisation of which can enhance our understanding of traits and interactions among individual organisms, populations and biodiversity dynamics in general. We explore the possibilities offered by secondary data and describe their main types and sources. An overview of research in this field provides a synthesis of the results already achieved using secondary data and different approaches to information extraction. Finally, we discuss challenges to the widespread use of secondary data, such as biases, licensing issues, use of metadata and lack of awareness of this trove of data due to a missing common terminology, as well as possible solutions to overcome these barriers.

This puts pressure on capture fishery as fish is a preferred protein source worldwide. However, the more resources we put into the capture fisheries to obtain maximum catch, the faster the fisheries stock becomes depleted. The best option left to produce enough fish to meet demand is relying on advanced aquaculture. Unfortunately, the impact of technological advancement in the aquaculture sector is not profound compared to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The advent of Cloud computing, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence (CIA) has expanded numerous possibilities for applying and integrating information technology in all works of life. This article reviews the emergence of research development on CIA and the potential to revolutionize the aquaculture industry. The use of CIA techniques and tools such as drones, nano and micro-sensors, bionic robots, remote cameras, intelligent sorting, energy-saving processing equipment, statistical modules, and algorithms will reduce human intervention and increase aquaculture productivity. Also, the application of CIA in the aquaculture value chain to ensure effectiveness in traceability, feeding, disease detection, growth prediction, environmental monitoring, market information, and others is key to increasing aquaculture productivity and sustainability. Therefore, the future of aquaculture operations with less human labour, effective maintenance, and resource utilization largely depend on innovative technologies.

In particular, when there is a class imbalance in the data, the final result tends to favor the large-class. In detection and recognition problems, the large-class will dominate due to its quantitative advantage, and the features of few-class can be not fully learned. In order to learn few-class, batch nuclear-norm maximization is introduced to the deep neural networks, and the mechanism of the adaptive composite loss function is established to increase the diversity of the network and thus improve the accuracy of prediction. The proposed loss function is added to the crowd counting, and verified on ShanghaiTech and UCF_CC_50 datasets.

A lack of protection combined with damage from growing human activities has contributed to the degradation of some of the Earth's richest marine biodiversity and highlights the urgent need to support improved marine conservation. High-resolution satellite imagery (VHR; 0.3â€“0.6Â m spatial resolution) provides a much-needed tool for monitoring sentinel species in remote oceans, which would strengthen current and future MPA research and monitoring programs across the globe. This perspective specifies how recent advances in VHR studies have contributed to knowledge regarding occurrence, habitat suitability, and abundance of mesopredators in the Southern Ocean. We demonstrate how knowledge gained through VHR offers a cost-effective and easily accessible method for collecting previously unobtainable data to inform a representative network of Southern Ocean MPAs, and how the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) could utilize this technology. As VHR and automated detection algorithms continue to improve, we showcase a promising opportunity to use these methods to complement current research and monitoring efforts, thus strengthening MPA efforts in the Southern Ocean and beyond.",,

However, it is much challenged by some factors like interocclusion, scale variances, perspective distortion, small object detection, and the carrier recognition of safety helmet. Traditional image-based methods suffer from them. This article proposes a new methodology for detecting safety helmet wearing, which makes use of convolutional neural network-based face detection and bounding-box regression for safety helmet detection. On the one hand, the method can help to recognize the carrier of the safety helmet and detect a multiscale and small safety helmet. On the other hand, deep transfer learning based on DenseNet is introduced and applied using two different strategies, namely, object feature extractor and fine-tuning for safety helmet recognition. To further improve the recognition accuracy, the network model with two peer DenseNet networks is trained by mutual distillation. Extensive analysis and experiments show that the novel methodology has considerable advantages in detecting safety helmet wearing compared to other state-of-the-art models. The proposed model has achieved 96.2% recall, 96.2% precision, and 94.47% average detection accuracy.

Acceptability judgments present a serious problem for both classical binary and probabilistic theories of grammaticality. These judgements are gradient in nature, and so cannot be directly accommodated in a binary formal grammar. However, it is also not possible to simply reduce acceptability to probability. The acceptability of a sentence is not the same as the likelihood of its occurrence, which is, in part, determined by factors like sentence length and lexical frequency. In this paper, we present the results of a set of large-scale experiments using crowd-sourced acceptability judgments that demonstrate gradience to be a pervasive feature in acceptability judgments. We then show how one can predict acceptability judgments on the basis of probability by augmenting probabilistic language models with an acceptability measure. This is a function that normalizes probability values to eliminate the confounding factors of length and lexical frequency. We describe a sequence of modeling experiments with unsupervised language models drawn from state-of-the-art machine learning methods in natural language processing. Several of these models achieve very encouraging levels of accuracy in the acceptability prediction task, as measured by the correlation between the acceptability measure scores and mean human acceptability values. We consider the relevance of these results to the debate on the nature of grammatical competence, and we argue that they support the view that linguistic knowledge can be intrinsically probabilistic.",,

We searched about 1200 related literature in public databases and selected five typical and state-of-the-art psychotherapy chatbots. Most of the state-of-the-art psychotherapy chatbots use retrieval-based methods to generate dialogs. Some psychotherapy chatbots incorporate psychological theories, such as cognitive behavior therapy, to solve unique psychological problems. The assessments show that chatbots can preliminarily recognize specific kinds of negative emotions and give relatively appropriate responses. The randomized controlled trials prove that psychotherapy chatbots are useful for some people with a mental health condition. Compared with real psychologists, psychotherapy chatbots have some advantages, such as accessibility without the limitation on time or location. However, some critical technical obstacles limit the usage of psychotherapy chatbots. The limitations require a series of necessary tasks for more effective and safer psychotherapy chatbots, such as collecting standard, valid, real, and rich corpora. In conclusion, current psychotherapy chatbots can hardly replace human psychologists in the short term, but they can improve human psychologists' effectiveness and efficiency as an auxiliary tool.",,

Therefore, it is most important to monitor such unforeseen situations by sensing the load imposed on the bridge structures. This scenario may arise where crowd movement is huge on these types of bridges. Similarly, the fiber Bragg grating (FBG) is a promising technology for structural health monitoring applications. In this work, an Internet of Things based FBG optical sensing scheme is proposed to monitor real-time strain distribution throughout the bridge structures and localization of load imposed on the structure from a central control room. A suspension bridge model is designed by referring to a real bridge scenario and these FBG sensors are deployed to validate the proposed machine learning models. In this article, the performances of two machine learning strategies are discussed for the accurate estimation of load and its position by acquiring high sensitive FBG sensors signals at a very high data rate. The algorithms include K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest (RF); which are applied on each sensing data source, and then validated using a prototype suspension bridge model integrated with three FBG sensors (1532 nm, 1538 nm, and1541â€‰nm) on a single optical fiber cable.",,

To this extent, violence detection (VD) has received substantial attention from the research community due to its vast applications, such as ensuring security over public areas and industrial settings through smart machine intelligence. However, because of changing illumination, complex background and low resolution, the analysis of violence patterns remains challenging in the industrial video surveillance domain. In this paper, we propose a computationally intelligent VD approach to precisely detect violent scenes through deep analysis of surveillance video sequential patterns. First, the video stream acquired through the vision sensor is processed by a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for the segmentation of important shots. Next, temporal optical flow features are extracted from the informative shots via a residential optical flow CNN. These are concatenated with appearance-invariant features extracted from a Darknet CNN model. Finally, a multilayer long short-term memory network is plugged to generate the final feature map for learning the violence patterns in a sequence of frames. In addition, we contribute to the existing surveillance VD data set by considering its indoor and outdoor scenarios separately for the proposed method's evaluation, achieving a 2% increase in accuracy over surveillance fight data set. Experiments also show encouraging results over the state of the art on other challenging benchmark data sets.",,

Based on these challenges, this paper proposes a new network model making use of stacked multicolumn convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pedestrian counting. The human's head features are used to replace the whole body for solving the problem of serious occlusion and choose multicolumn CNNs for dealing with scale and scene perspective distortion. Also, pretrained VGG-16 is used to generate deeper detailed features and expand the receptive field of the model.

However, the authors observed that the rich colour and texture information of the RGB modality makes the objects more prominent compared to the background; and the thermal modality records the temperature difference of the scene, so the objects usually contain clear and continuous edge information. In this work, a novel mirror-complementary Transformer network (MCNet) is proposed for RGB-T SOD, which supervise the two modalities separately with a complementary set of saliency labels under a symmetrical structure. Moreover, the attention-based feature interaction and serial multiscale dilated convolution (SDC)-based feature fusion modules are introduced to make the two modalities complement and adjust each other flexibly. When one modality fails, the proposed model can still accurately segment the salient regions. To demonstrate the robustness of the proposed model under challenging scenes in real world, the authors build a novel RGB-T SOD dataset VT723 based on a large public semantic segmentation RGB-T dataset used in the autonomous driving domain.

Recent research studies have revealed that end-user reviews contain rich and pivotal sources of information for the software vendors and developers that can help undertake software evolution and maintenance tasks. However, such user-generated information is often fragmented, with multiple viewpoints from various stakeholders involved in the ongoing discussions in the Reddit forum. In this article, we proposed a crowd-based requirements engineering by valuation argumentation (CrowdRE-VArg) approach that analyzes the end-users discussion in the Reddit forum and identifies conflict-free new features, design alternatives, or issues, and reach a rationale-based requirements decision by gradually valuating the relative strength of their supporting and attacking arguments. The proposed approach helps to negotiate the conflict over the new features or issues between the different crowd-users on the run by finding a settlement that satisfies the involved crowd-users in the ongoing discussion in the Reddit forum using argumentation theory. For this purpose, we adopted the bipolar gradual valuation argumentation framework, extended from the abstract argumentation framework and abstract valuation framework. The automated CrowdRE-VArg approach is illustrated through a sample crowd-users conversation topic adopted from the Reddit forum about Google Map mobile application. Finally, we applied natural language processing and different machine learning algorithms to support the automated execution of the CrowdRE-VArg approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed CrowdRE-VArg approach works as a proof-of-concept and automatically identifies prioritized requirements-related information for software engineers.",,

Current literature states that this partial use sub-optimizes the educational benefit gained by the visitor, and that skilled visitors view an exhibition comprehensively and systematically. Contrary to that viewpoint, this paper argues that partial use of exhibitions is an intelligent and effective strategy for the visitor whose goal is to have curiosity piqued and satisfied. By using analytical approaches derived from â€œoptimal foraging theoryâ€ in ecology, this paper demonstrates that the curiosity-driven visitor seeks to maximize the Total Interest Value of his or her museum visit. Such visitors use a set of simple heuristics to find and focus attention only on exhibit elements with high interest value and low search costs. Their selective use of exhibit elements results in greater achievement of their own goals than would be gained by using the exhibition comprehensively.",,

Objects similar to the human face or multi-view faces in low-resolution images may result in the failure of face recognition. To alleviate the above problems, a real-time face recognition method based on pre-identification and multi-scale classification is proposed in this study. The face area is segmented based on the proportion of human faces in the pedestrian area to reduce the search range, and faces can be robustly detected in complicated scenarios such as heads moving frequently or with large angles. To accurately recognise small-scale faces, the authors propose the multi-scale and multi-channel shallow convolution network, which combines a multi-scale mechanism on the feature map with a multi-channel convolution network for real-time face recognition. It performs face matching only in the pre-identified face areas instead of the whole image, therefore it is more efficient. Experimental results showed that the proposed real-time face recognition method detects and recognises faces correctly, and outperforms the existing methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",,

The conventional information collection method which is based on unmanned aerial vehicles, helicopters etc. has the access limitations in terrains such as tunnels, hilly regions, river bridges, dense forests etc. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes the railway vehicular crowdsensing method in which one group of trains participates in this information collection and another group of trains confirms the validity of the collected information.

Magnetically labeled cells appear as dark contrast in T2*-weighted MRI, with sensitivities of individual cells. One key hurdle to the widespread use of MRI-based cell tracking is the inability to determine the number of transplanted cells based on this contrast feature. In the case of single cell detection, manual enumeration of spots in three-dimensional (3D) MRI in principle is possible; however, it is a tedious and time-consuming task that is prone to subjectivity and inaccuracy on a large scale. This research presents the first comprehensive study on how a computer-based intelligent, automatic, and accurate cell quantification approach can be designed for spot detection in MRI scans. Methods Magnetically labeled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were transplanted into rats using an intracardiac injection, accomplishing single cell seeding in the brain. T2*-weighted MRI of these rat brains were performed where labeled MSCs appeared as spots. Using machine learning and computer vision paradigms, approaches were designed to systematically explore the possibility of automatic detection of these spots in MRI. Experiments were validated against known in vitro scenarios. Results Using the proposed deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, an in vivo accuracy up to 97.3% and in vitro accuracy of up to 99.8% was achieved for automated spot detection in MRI data.

In this paper, we discover that code changes can imply what users want and propose a novel query expansion technique with code changes (QECC). It exploits (changes, contexts) pairs from changed methods. On the basis of statistical learning from pairs, it can infer code changes for a given query. In this way, it expands a query with code changes and recommends the query results that meet actual needs perfectly. In addition, we implement InstaRec to perform QECC and evaluate it with 195â€‰039 change commits from GitHub and our code tracker.

In this research, we propose a fully automated end-to-end image detection system to predict flood stage data using deep neural networks across two US Geological Survey (USGS) gauging stations, that is, the Columbus and the Sweetwater Creek, Georgia, USA. The images were driven from the USGS live river web cameras, which were strategically located nearby the monitoring stations and refreshed roughly every 30Â s. To estimate the flood stage, a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (U-Net CNN) was first stacked on top of a segmentation model for noise and feature reduction that diminished the number of images needed for training. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a dense model, and a CNN were then trained to predict the flood stage time series data in near real-time (6, 12, 24, and 48Â hr). The results revealed that the U-Net CNN has a higher accuracy for image segmentation if the algorithm is stacked in front of the network. The absolute error with the U-Net was 0.0654 feet at the Columbus while it was 0.0035 feet at the Sweetwater Creek, which were practically low for flood stage estimation. For time series prediction, among three models, the LSTM predicted the flood stage values more accurately during both historical (2015â€“2022) as well as real-time forecasts, particularly for 24 and 48Â hr timescales.

The detection device utilizes the high-performance computing of Jetson Nano to realize real-time detection of drowning events through the proposed drowning detection algorithm on the acquired underwater video stream. The proposed drowning detection algorithm primarily consists of two stages: in the first step, to successfully solve the interference of the surroundings and to give a trustworthy basis for video drowning detection, the YOLOv5n network is used to detect the near-vertical human body based on the characteristics of the drowning person.

Second, the T-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (T-SNE) data dimensional reduction technique is used. Third, Random Forest (RF) technique is utilised to evaluate the complications in the accuracy and False-Positive Rate (FPR). The proposed approach has been tested on various well-known datasets, namely, UNSW-NB 15, CICIDS-2017, and phishing datasets. The proposed novel approach achieved significant results compared with existing approaches, achieving 100% accuracy, and 0% FPR for the UNSW-NB15 dataset, and achieving high accuracy rates, up to 99.7878%, and 99.7044%, for CICIDS-2017 and Phishing datasets respectively.",,

In this study, the authors propose a robust feature descriptor named regional adaptive affinitive patterns (RADAP) for facial expression recognition. The RADAP computes positional adaptive thresholds in the local neighbourhood and encodes multi-distance magnitude features which are robust to intra-class variations and irregular illumination variation in an image. Furthermore, they established cross-distance co-occurrence relations in RADAP by using logical operators. They proposed XRADAP, ARADAP, and DRADAP using xor, adder and decoder, respectively. The XRADAP engrains the quality of robustness to intra-class variations in RADAP features using pairwise co-occurrence. Similarly, ARADAP and DRADAP extract more stable and illumination invariant features and capture the minute expression features which are usually missed by regular descriptors. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated by conducting experiments on nine benchmark datasets Cohnâ€“Kanade+ (CK+), Japanese female facial expression (JAFFE), Multimedia Understanding Group (MUG), MMI, OULU-CASIA, Indian spontaneous expression database, DISFA, AFEW and Combined (CK+, JAFFE, MUG, MMI & GEMEP-FERA) database in both person dependent and person independent setup.

IoT finds its applications in many fields as environment monitoring, logistics, health care, automobile, controlled industrial environment, smart cities, and many more. As the devices, their cardinality and alignment, the data type, the data rate and specifics of the domain of the IoT applications vary; there is also a need to define architectures that incorporate the devices, communication mediums, storage, and analysis capabilities and the consumers of the derived output.

The main factors that hinder progress in this area are lack of training data and difficulty of automatic evaluation. Thus, to reliably evaluate the quality of such models, one needs to resort to time-consuming and expensive human evaluation. We tackle these problems by organizing the Conversational Intelligence Challenge (ConvAI) â€” open competition of dialogue systems. Our goals are threefold: to work out a good design for human evaluation of open-domain dialogue, to grow open-source code base for conversational systems, and to harvest and publish new datasets. Over the course of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions, we developed a framework for evaluation of chatbots in messaging platforms and used it to evaluate over 30 dialogue systems in two conversational tasks â€” discussion of short text snippets from Wikipedia and personalized small talk. These large-scale evaluation experiments were performed by recruiting volunteers as well as paid workers. As a result, we succeeded in collecting a dataset of around 5,000 long meaningful human-to-bot dialogues and got many insights into the organization of human evaluation. This dataset can be used to train an automatic evaluation model or to improve the quality of dialogue systems. Our analysis of ConvAI1 and ConvAI2 competitions shows that the future work in this area should be centered around the more active participation of volunteers in the assessment of dialogue systems.

In previous studies, many methods have been proposed to stabilize shaky videos. However, these methods fail to balance between image content integrity and stability. Some methods sacrifice image content for better stability. Other methods ignore the subtle jitters, which leads to poor stability. This work innovatively proposes a video stabilization method based on decomposed motion compensation. First, a grid-based motion statistics method is adopted for motion estimation, which obtains more accurate motion vectors according to matched likelihood estimates. Then, the motion compensation is inherently decomposed into two parts: linear motion compensation and auxiliary motion compensation. Linear motion compensation removes complex jitter by constructing linear path constraints to obtain a more stable camera path. Auxiliary motion compensation uses a moving average filter to remove the high-frequency jitter as a supplement and preserve more image content. The two components are combined with individual weights to derive the final transform matrix and warp the original frames. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the previous methods on NUS and DeepStab datasets qualitatively andÂ quantitatively.",,

In this paper, we examine the efforts of the Jakarta Smart City programme and office to govern these challenges. Where smart cities are often described as offering speed and real-time efficiency, we instead find that the technologies and practices mobilised by the Jakarta Smart City programme govern by projecting, delaying and hypothesising into the future. We describe these governance strategies and outline three of their key forms: keeping track of objects and people, calculating and projecting state savings, and mundane watching but not acting. Rather than facilitating exacting and real-time policy responses to address these urban problems, these practices instead produce temporal relations of delay that push action further into the future.

However, in heterogeneous hardware environments, it can become increasingly difficult to find viable partitions of the simulation and provide implementations for different hardware devices. To automate this process, we present OpenABLext, an extension to OpenABL, a model specification language for ABSs. By providing a device-aware OpenCL backend, OpenABLext enables the co-execution of ABS on heterogeneous hardware platforms consisting of central processing units, GPUs, and field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We present a novel online dispatching method that efficiently profiles partitions of the simulation during run-time to optimize the hardware assignment while using the profiling results to advance the simulation itself. In addition, OpenABLext features automated conflict resolution based on user-specified rules, supports graph-based simulation spaces, and utilizes an efficient neighbor search algorithm. We show the improved performance of OpenABLext and demonstrate the potential of FPGAs in the context of ABS. We illustrate how co-execution can be used to further lower execution times.

However, existing anomaly detection databases encounter two major problems. Firstly, they are limited in scale. Secondly, training sets contain only video-level labels indicating the existence of an abnormal event during the full video while lacking annotations of precise time durations. To tackle these problems, we contribute a new Large-scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database as the benchmark for anomaly detection in video sequences, which is featured in two aspects. 1) It contains 2000 video sequences including normal and abnormal video clips with 14 anomaly categories includingÂ crash, fire, violenceÂ etc. with large scene varieties, making it the largest anomaly analysis database to date. 2) It provides the annotation data, including video-level labels (abnormal/normal video, anomaly type) and frame-level labels (abnormal/normal video frame) to facilitate anomaly detection. Leveraging the above benefits from the LAD database, we further formulate anomaly detection as a fully supervised learning problem and propose a multi-task deep neural network to solve it. We firstly obtain the local spatiotemporal contextual feature by using an Inflated 3D convolutional (I3D) network. Then we construct a recurrent convolutional neural network fed the local spatiotemporal contextual feature to extract the spatiotemporal contextual feature. With the global spatiotemporal contextual feature, the anomaly type and score can be computed simultaneously by a multi-task neural network.

Therefore, the authors propose a one-stage detection network CFNet (cross-layer feature fusion and fusion weight attention network), in which a fusion weight attention mechanism module (FWAM) is proposed to give different weights to the fused features in order to distinguish the importance of different features. The module increases the weights of features that contain strong information so that the fused features are focused on feature points that are beneficial for optimal head detection. Meanwhile, a cross-layer feature fusion module is proposed to fuse information from different resolution feature maps to compensate for the decrease in detection accuracy caused by the omission of information features at low resolution, and a connection network for contextual information fusion is constructed, while weight parameter value settings are introduced to optimize the detection effect after fusion of different resolution features.

Although the existing anchor-free methods have fast inference speed, they are not suitable for object detection in crowded scenes due to the model's inability to predict the well-fined object detection bounding boxes. This work proposes an end-to-end anchor-free network, Multi-dimensional Weighted Cross-Attention Network (MANet), which can perform real-time human detection in crowded scenes. Specifically, the Double-flow Weighted Feature Cascade Module (DW-FCM) is used in the extractor to highlight the contribution of features at different levels. The Triplet Cross Attention Module (TCAM) is used in the detector head to enhance the association dependence of multi-dimension features, further strengthening human boundary features' discrimination ability at a fine-grained level. Moreover, the strategy of Adaptively Opposite Thrust Mapping (AOTM) ground-truth annotation is proposed to achieve bias correction of erroneous mappings and reduce the iterations of useless learning of the network. These strategies effectively alleviate the defect that the existing anchor-free network cannot correctly distinguish and locate the individual human in crowded scenes. Compared with the anchor-based detection method, there is no need to set anchor parameters manually, and the detection speed can satisfy the real-time application. Finally, through extensive comparative experiments on CrowdHuman and WIDER FACE datasets, the results demonstrate that the improved strategy achieves the state-of-the-art result in the anchor-freeÂ methods.",,

Initially, camera nodes are randomly deployed in the visual sensor network, and the data are received from the network through gateway. To identify the redundant nodes, initially, the frames are divided into equivalent time slot, and then, Siamese network is utilized to identify the redundant nodes in a network. Siamese neural network is type of convolutional neural network that is utilized to recognize the similar images in the network. After that, faulty nodes are identified based on some parameters such as entropy, energy, transmission delay and network coverage.

Efficient open-source tools have recently emerged that allow animal behaviour to be quantified from videos using machine learning and computer vision techniques, but there is limited appraisal of how these tools perform compared to traditional methods. To gain insight into how different methods perform in extracting data from videos taken in the field, we compared estimates of the parental provisioning rate of wild house sparrows Passer domesticus from video recordings. We compared four methods: manual annotation by experts, crowd-sourcing, automatic detection based on the open-source software DeepMeerkat, and a hybrid annotation method. We found that the data collected by the automatic method correlated with expert annotation (râ€‰=â€‰0.62) and further show that these data are biologically meaningful as they predict brood survival. However, the automatic method produced largely biased estimates due to the detection of non-visitation events, while the crowd-sourcing and hybrid annotation produced estimates that are equivalent to expert annotation. The hybrid annotation method takes approximately 20% of annotation time compared to manual annotation, making it a more cost-effective way to collect data from videos. We provide a successful case study of how different approaches can be adopted and evaluated with a pre-existing dataset, to make informed decisions on the best way to process video datasets. If pre-existing frameworks produce biased estimates, we encourage researchers to adopt a hybrid approach of first using machine learning frameworks to preprocess videos, and then to do manual annotation to save annotation time. As open-source machine learning tools are becoming more accessible, we encourage biologists to make use of these tools to cut annotation time but still get equally accurate results without the need to develop novel algorithms from scratch.",,

The main issues of resource provisioning are meeting user demands like bandwidth, response time, throughput, availability, and so on. The cloud computing framework uses virtualization technology to provide on-demand access to computer system resources, specifically computation and storage. In cloud computing, computing resources are shared across another communication network using virtualization. However, the cloud computing mechanism cannot meet the needs of a large number of Internet of Things (IoT) services. To consider this, fog computing was introduced as a modified mechanism of the cloud paradigm by providing cloud services for the end devices. Fog computing is a decentralized computing model placed between devices, edges, data centers or the cloud. In this way, it helps to meet the demands initiated by IoT services, such as reduced latency, wide mobility coverage, and so on. Several solutions regarding resource allocation in fog computing are available in the research field, but such solutions have not achieved satisfactory results. Therefore, finding a solution by analyzing recent problems is open research. Therefore, this paper reviews different methods established for resource provisioning in fog computing using different parameters from 2015 to 2021 and introduces the limitations, advantages and future directions related to different resource provisioning techniques.",,

Next to providing traditional connectivity like its previous generations, 5G also promises to be a heterogeneous network connecting humans, vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), smart devices, and more. These challenging expectations proved to be overwhelming for traditional network infrastructures to handle. Network slicing has emerged as a promising solution that can achieve such diverse, taxing, and sometimes conflicting requirements in a dynamic and programmable way. There is no denying that UAVs have attained significant focus and research in recent years, and with 5G already being deployed, UAVs can now exploit the capabilities of the new networks. Extensive research is being taken to integrate UAVs into networks, assisting and improving aspects like latency, coverage, and capacity. Motivated by these facts, this survey distinguishes itself from other works by jointly exploring 5G, network slicing, and UAVs. The main contributions of this article are to showcase how UAVs can assist networks, provide a taxonomy of UAVs in the context of network slicing, and survey works that contribute to network slicing with UAVs. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on UAVs in the context of network slicing, covering contributions, and state-of-the-art literature. We discuss network slicing in-depth, focusing especially on the three major slices: enhanced Mobile BroadBand, massive machine type communications, and ultra-reliable low-latency communications. We provide an overview of 5G enablers, including software-defined networking and network function virtualization. We cover UAVs and identify their roles in networks as both users and assistants. Furthermore, this survey provides insight into open issues and future research directions related to network slicing and UAVs before concluding.",,

Part of the scepticism is due to disparity between the common perception of journalsâ€™ prestige and their ranking based on citation counts. A more serious concern is the inappropriate use of journal rankings to evaluate the scientific influence of researchers. The paper focuses on analysis of the table of cross-citations among a selection of statistics journals. Data are collected from the Web of Science database published by Thomson Reuters. Our results suggest that modelling the exchange of citations between journals is useful to highlight the most prestigious journals, but also that journal citation data are characterized by considerable heterogeneity, which needs to be properly summarized. Inferential conclusions require care to avoid potential overinterpretation of insignificant differences between journal ratings. Comparison with published ratings of institutions from the UK's research assessment exercise shows strong correlation at aggregate level between assessed research quality and journal citation â€˜export scoresâ€™ within the discipline of statistics.",,

In this survey, we provide an up-to-date integrative view of the field, bridging complementary views coming from computer graphics and computer vision. After providing a characterization of input sources, we define the structure of output models and the priors exploited to bridge the gap between imperfect sources and desired output. We then identify and discuss the main components of a structured reconstruction pipeline, and review how they are combined in scalable solutions working at the building level. We finally point out relevant research issues and analyze research trends.",,

This proposed work is the first approach for code-mixed Hindi-English social media text that comprises language identification, detection and correction of non-word (Out of Vocabulary) errors as well as real-word errors occurring simultaneously. Each identified language (Devanagari Hindi, Roman Hindi, and English) has its own complexities and challenges. Errors are detected individually for each language and a suggestive list of the erroneous words is created. After this, a fuzzy graph between different words of the suggestive lists is generated using various semantic relations in Hindi WordNet. Word embeddings and Fuzzy graph-based centrality measures are used to find the correct word. Several experiments are performed on different social media datasets taken from Instagram, Twitter, YouTube comments, Blogs, and WhatsApp. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system corrects out-of-vocabulary words as well as real-word errors with a maximum recall of 0.90 and 0.67, respectively for Dev_Hindi and 0.87 and 0.66, respectively for Rom_Hindi.

It is essential to focus on monitoring and controlling the production system before complex accidents occur. To overcome above research gaps, we shift to industrial 4.0, which combine IoT and mechanism learning for industrial monitor and manage. Here, we propose a hybrid machine learning technique for IoT enabled industrial monitoring and control system (IoT-HML). The main goal of the research is to overcome the issues of information security and control systems by developing a hybrid machine learning technique. Compared to the existing AODV protocol, the proposed C-IWO based routing protocol outperformed efficiently in terms of 19.2% average delay, 12.7% average energy consumption, 10.26% average throughput, 3.8% average delivery ratio, and 16.33% average loss ratio, respectively.

Artificial life aims to foster a comprehensive study of life beyond â€œlife as we know itâ€ and toward â€œlife as it could be,â€ with theoretical, synthetic, and empirical models of the fundamental properties of living systems. While still a relatively young field, artificial life has flourished as an environment for researchers with different backgrounds, welcoming ideas, and contributions from a wide range of subjects. Hybrid Life brings our attention to some of the most recent developments within the artificial life community, rooted in more traditional artificial life studies but looking at new challenges emerging from interactions with other fields. Hybrid Life aims to cover studies that can lead to an understanding, from first principles, of what systems are and how biological and artificial systems can interact and integrate to form new kinds of hybrid (living) systems, individuals, and societies. To do so, it focuses on three complementary perspectives: theories of systems and agents, hybrid augmentation, and hybrid interaction. Theories of systems and agents are used to define systems, how they differ (e.g., biological or artificial, autonomous, or nonautonomous), and how multiple systems relate in order to form new hybrid systems. Hybrid augmentation focuses on implementations of systems so tightly connected that they act as a single, integrated one. Hybrid interaction is centered around interactions within a heterogeneous group of distinct living and nonliving systems. After discussing some of the major sources of inspiration for these themes, we will focus on an overview of the works that appeared in Hybrid Life special sessions, hosted by the annual Artificial Life Conference between 2018 and 2022.

On the other hand, the lack of practical solutions to include SDGs in university activity is constantly emphasised. The objective of the article is to investigate how project-based learning innovations used in student education affect the achievement of sustainable development goals. We analyse whether innovative project basedâ€“learning projects at a leading technology university in Poland pursued from 2018 to 2021 contribute to achieving sustainable development goals, and we study the matter of interdisciplinarity of the project teams. To this end, we employ a qualitative content analysis of reports for 108 projects that involved 324 researchers, 607 students, and 233 experts from the university's business environment. The categorical data yielded by the analysis are analysed with quantitative methods: frequency analysis, correspondence analysis, and data visualisation. The analyses demonstrated that the most commonly pursued sustainable development goals were: SDG 9: Industry Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, and SDG 12: Responsible Production and Construction. Biomedical Engineering experts pursued projects dedicated to SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, while Automation and Robotics specialists focused on SDGs 9: Industry Innovation and Infrastructure and SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. The primary sustainable development goal for Environmental Engineering teams was SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production followed by SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation and 7: Affordable and Clean Energy. The most common interdisciplinarity in the teams was of the second type: interdisciplinarity bringing together experts from two research areas. The article presents the results of research on the process of promoting sustainable development through project-based learning implemented under an interdisciplinary collaboration of teams of university staff, students, and experts from businesses associated with the university. The results contribute to the academic debate on the ability of universities to teach, implement, and promote sustainable development and its goals.",,

Today, the banner of this plannable future is borne by technology. Allegedly impersonal, neutral, and exempt from disillusionment with ideology, belief in technological change saturates the present horizon of historical futures. Yet I argue that this is exactly how today's technofutures enact a hegemony of closure and sameness. In particular, the growing emphasis on prediction as AI's skeleton key to all social problems constitutes what religious studies calls cosmograms: universalizing models that govern how facts and values relate to each other, providing a common and normative point of reference. In a predictive paradigm, social problems are made conceivable only as objects of calculative controlâ€”control that can never be fulfilled but that persists as an eternally deferred and recycled horizon. I show how this technofuture is maintained not so much by producing literally accurate predictions of future events but through ritualized demonstrations of predictive time.",,

The objective of this paper is to offer an overview of the literature regarding the impact of online user reviews on economic indicators (e.g., sales, marketing strategies) and on consumer behavior. Furthermore, following the growing interest of academics and professionals alike on the topic, the present work provides an exploratory analysis of the consequences of online reviews on individual rating behavior â€“ empirical regularities showed that online rating distributions tend to be concentrated on extreme values, possibly because of rating biases. As consumers and firms incorporate the heuristic cues from such distributions into their decision-making processes, biased ratings might lead to suboptimal choices.

However, traditional methods for measuring plant morphology are time consuming and have limited scalability. We present LeafMachine2, a suite of modular machine learning and computer vision tools that can automatically extract a base set of leaf traits from digital plant data sets. Methods LeafMachine2 was trained on 494,766 manually prepared annotations from 5648 herbarium images obtained from 288 institutions and representing 2663 species; it employs a set of plant component detection and segmentation algorithms to isolate individual leaves, petioles, fruits, flowers, wood samples, buds, and roots. Our landmarking network automatically identifies and measures nine pseudo-landmarks that occur on most broadleaf taxa. Text labels and barcodes are automatically identified by an archival component detector and are prepared for optical character recognition methods or natural language processing algorithms. Results LeafMachine2 can extract trait data from at least 245 angiosperm families and calculate pixel-to-metric conversion factors for 26 commonly used ruler types. Discussion LeafMachine2 is a highly efficient tool for generating large quantities of plant trait data, even from occluded or overlapping leaves, field images, and non-archival data sets. Our project, along with similar initiatives, has made significant progress in removing the bottleneck in plant trait data acquisition from herbarium specimens and shifted the focus toward the crucial task of data revision and quality control.",,

Objectives To summarise the Web-based â€˜channelsâ€™ that may assist the actors of the health care system (clinicians, medical researchers and students) to keep up to date with medical information. Methods We searched PubMed and Scopus for English language articles published between January 1990 and February 2019 that investigated ways for keeping up with medical information. We used the results from our search and relevant information from other sources to conduct a narrative synthesis. Results We found that resources that push information (e.g. web alerts, medical newsletters, listservs), resources that rely on the active information seeking (e.g. access to health librarians and electronic databases, podcasts, mobile apps), collaborative resources (e.g. web conferences, online journal clubs, web social media) and resources that synthesise information (e.g. bibliometrics, living systematic reviews) can contribute in keeping up with new findings and can enhance evidence-based medicine.

The discussion on innovation and GCs is still lacking sufficient theoretical underpinnings and empirical insights to make sense of the role of for-profit firms and their collaborative innovation efforts to address the GCs of our times. We introduce innovation ecosystems as a theoretical lens for understanding the combinations of technological interfaces and strategic relations that firms can employ to craft value propositions with high potential for tackling GCs. Empirically, this study focuses on the GC of climate change that requires a transformation of the electricity sector. We investigate collaborative pilot projects between 10 international electric utilities and 57 clean-tech startups. In these pilots, incumbents and new entrants explore low-carbon value propositions through novel technological interfaces and strategic relations. Via qualitative comparative analysis, we identify three configurations of ecosystem realignment with high climate impact: an incumbent-led digital platform realignment, a device complementor and customer-enabling realignment, and a new orchestrator realignment. Based on a multiple case analysis, we uncover three innovation mechanisms that explain why these specific configurations unlock climate impact: they enhance resource efficiency, the flexibility and resilience of infrastructure, and the trading and leveraging of information and resources. On this basis, we contribute to the literature at the intersection of innovation management and GCs by developing theory that explicates (1) how the realignment of incumbents and startups in innovation ecosystems changes existing industry structures; (2) why specific configurations of such ecosystems are associated with high climate impact and are thus effective in addressing GCs; and (3) the boundary conditions under which collective innovation efforts in ecosystems can translate into climate impact.",,

Business Intelligence (BI) is no longer restricted to querying about marketing and sales data only. It is more about linking data from disparate applications and also churning through large volumes of unstructured data like emails, call logs, social media, News, and so on in an attempt to derive insights that can also provide actionable intelligence and better inputs for future strategy making. Semantic technologies like knowledge graphs have proved to be useful tools that help in linking disparate data sources intelligently and also enable reasoning through complex networks that are created as a result of this linking. Over the last decade the process of creation, storage, and maintenance of knowledge graphs have sufficiently matured, and they are now making inroads into business decision making also. Very recently, these graphs are also seen as a potential way to reduce hallucinations of large language models, by including these during pre-training as well as generation of output. There are a number of challenges also. These include building and maintaining the graphs, reasoning with missing links, and so on.

The fast pace expanding of IoT devices and sensors in smart cities generates a huge volume of data that can help decision-makers and managers in city management. The aim of this article is to wholly and systematically review big data handling approaches in smart cities, in which we analyze research efforts published between 2013 and February 2021, where these techniques are categorized based on their algorithms and architectures. Further, the main ideas, evaluation techniques, tools, evaluation metrics, algorithm types, advantages, and disadvantages are explored. Additionally, essential evaluation factors are introduced in which scalability and availability by 16%, time by 15% and accuracy by 11% are more in focus, and finally, some of the challenges, open issues, and future trends that are valuable for further research are suggested in big data handling approaches in smart cities.",,

Also, it is focused upon modeling and characterizing in-vivo wireless channel, as well as contrasting it to other well-known channels. In this paper, channel coding is also mentioned because it improves data rates and performance gain. This work also discusses present problems and potential research topics for in-vivo communications. This article aims to show the researchers how the orthogonal frequency multiple access (OFDMA) technique improved the performance of in-vivo channel and how it is outperformed compared to the other techniques (TDM, TDMA, CDMA and OFDM) also how the OFDMA outperformed equalizers and channel coding in terms of bit error rate with giving a significant improvement of data transmitting and avoiding inter symbol interference. However, when it comes to the in-vivo communications, the modeling of in-vivo wireless channel is vital.

However, processing resources are still a limiting factor. Hence, many costly but desirable aspects of realism are often not accounted for, including global illumination, accurate depth of field and motion blur, spectral effects, etc. especially in real-time rendering. At the same time, there is a strong trend towards more pixels per display due to larger displays, higher pixel densities or larger fields of view. Further observable trends in current display technology include more bits per pixel (high dynamic range, wider color gamut/fidelity), increasing refresh rates (better motion depiction), and an increasing number of displayed views per pixel (stereo, multi-view, all the way to holographic or lightfield displays). These developments cause significant unsolved technical challenges due to aspects such as limited compute power and bandwidth. Fortunately, the human visual system has certain limitations, which mean that providing the highest possible visual quality is not always necessary. In this report, we present the key research and models that exploit the limitations of perception to tackle visual quality and workload alike. Moreover, we present the open problems and promising future research targeting the question of how we can minimize the effort to compute and display only the necessary pixels while still offering a user full visual experience.",,

Our analysis reveals that IS publications from India are relatively few in number, though increasing in recent years; hardly focussed on context-specific issues and concerns; and are largely in lower-ranked journals. Using neo-institutional theory, we show that the reasons are dominantly coercive (measuring up to rankings and accreditation agencies) and mimetic (following leaders). Normative (influence of professional bodies) forces appear to counterbalance this by necessitating continuous improvement in research outputs and emphasising location-specific, impactful research. Institutional responses to these forces manifest in policies and mechanisms to operationalise them, such as resource availability, balancing teaching load with research expectations, promotion and tenure policies amongst others. We examine the paths by which more rigorous and relevant research, responsible to a location can be achieved, based on the insights from a series of talks given by eminent IS scholars. We opine that there is a need to consciously seek out such paths, perhaps by actively seeking collaboration with other disciplines and practitioners; establishing programmes of research; and building contextualised theories. We conclude with a relook at the underlying dynamics of the various institutional responses, recommended paths and some policy implications of our findings.",,

We advocate that instructors use inclusive teaching practices, specifically through active learning, in their online classes. Incorporating pedagogical practices that work to maximize active and inclusive teaching concepts will be beneficial for all students, and especially those from minoritized or underserved groups. Like many STEM fields, Ecology and Evolution shows achievement gaps and faces a leaky pipeline issue for students from groups traditionally underserved in science. Making online classes both active and inclusive will aid student learning and will also help students feel more connected to their learning, their peers, and their campus. This approach will likely help with performance, retention, and persistence of students.

Existing heatmap-based approaches are devoted to reducing the effect by optimizing backbone architecture or loss functions, but the problem of an inaccurate heatmap representation with different keypoint scales still exists. A scale-sensitive heatmap algorithm is presented to generate reasonable spatial and contextual features for the network to predict more precise coordinates, by systematically considering the standard deviation, truncated radius, and shape of Gaussian kernels. Specifically, the scale-sensitive heatmap algorithm contains three parts: inter-person heatmap, limited-area heatmap, and shape-aware heatmap. The inter-person heatmap allocates different standard deviations for each human instance proportionally calculated by the keypoint-based method, the limited-area heatmap defines the truncated radius to limit the influence area of Gaussian kernels, and the shape-aware heatmap modifies the Gaussian kernels generated by some ellipse-shaped joints. Our scale-sensitive heatmap algorithm outperforms the baseline by a considerable margin on the COCO and CrowdPose benchmark datasets.

Recent years have witnessed significant efforts in numerical modeling and data collection of the urban environment. Nonetheless, it is difficult for the physical-based models to fully utilize the high-resolution data under the constraints of computing resources. The advancement in machine learning (ML) techniques offers the computational strength to handle the massive volume of data. In this study, we proposed a modeling framework that uses ML approach to estimate point-scale street-level air temperature from the urban-resolving meso-scale climate model and a suite of hyper-resolution urban geospatial data sets, including three-dimensional urban morphology, parcel-level land use inventory, and weather observations from a sensor network. We implemented this approach in the City of Chicago as a case study to demonstrate the capability of the framework. The proposed approach vastly improves the resolution of temperature predictions in cities, which will help the city with walkability, drivability, and heat-related behavioral studies. Moreover, we tested the model's reliability on out-of-sample locations to investigate the modeling uncertainties and the application potentials to the other areas.

To address this, various cell association schemes have been proposed. However, the current schemes ignore users' mobility information, and as a result, their cell admission and bandwidth allocation policy are reactive. In order to enable proactive bandwidth management in emerging 5G fog access radio networks (FRANs), we proposed a novel mobility-aware cell association scheme (MACA) that exploits user's mobility and downlink rate demand information to associate it with the maximum rate offering cell. In MACA, the mobility prediction model consists of long-short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural network that considers joint information of unique cell identification numbers with the corresponding sojourn times and predicts the user's most probable next cell. Later, the underlying future cell assignment is formulated as a convex problem and solved using the Lagrangian dual decomposition method and compared the proposed framework performance with Semi-Markov, deep neural network (DNN), and MaxRSRP-based cell association approaches in terms of the next cell prediction accuracy, the impact of downlink rate allocation, and user satisfaction percentage. MACA scheme is trained using two publicly available pedestrian datasets. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme performs significantly better than the other schemes and yields the average next cell prediction accuracy of 93.42%, 1.63 times higher downlink rates, and 56.8% users satisfied with the allocated bandwidth.",,

Recently, encoding word properties into low-dimensional vector spaces using neural networks has become increasingly popular. Word embeddings are now used as the main input to natural language processing (NLP) applications, achieving cutting-edge results. Nevertheless, most word-embedding studies are carried out with general-domain text and evaluation datasets, and their results do not necessarily apply to text from other domains (e.g., biomedicine) that are linguistically distinct from general English. To achieve maximum benefit when using word embeddings for biomedical NLP tasks, they need to be induced and evaluated using in-domain resources. Thus, it is essential to create a detailed review of biomedical embeddings that can be used as a reference for researchers to train in-domain models. In this paper, we review biomedical word embedding studies from three key aspects: the corpora, models and evaluation methods. We first describe the characteristics of various biomedical corpora, and then compare popular embedding models. After that, we discuss different evaluation methods for biomedical embeddings. For each aspect, we summarize the various challenges discussed in the literature.

Ten percent studies were about requirements elicitation and prioritization activities, 7% of the studies support both requirements elicitation and negotiation activities, and prioritization activity was supported by 7% of the studies. It was also observed that 58% of the selected studies adopted semi-automatic approaches to conduct RE activities while 21% of the selected studies proposed automatic tools, and 21% of the selected studies adopted manual approaches to conduct RE activities. The outcomes of this systematic literature review indicate that social network sites can be a major source that can be used successfully to extract and identify user requirements. Moreover, this systematic literature review also presents implications of this study for practitioners and researchers including challenges, unresolved issues, and future research directions.",,

The inherent closed-loop responsiveness and decision making of IoT applications make them ideal candidates for using low latency and scalable stream processing platforms. Distributed stream processing systems (DSPS) hosted in cloud data centers are becoming the vital engine for real-time data processing and analytics in any IoT software architecture. But the efficacy and performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for IoT applications and data streams. Here, we propose RIoTBench, a real-time IoT benchmark suite, along with performance metrics, to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes 27 common IoT tasks classified across various functional categories and implemented as modular microbenchmarks. Further, we define four IoT application benchmarks composed from these tasks based on common patterns of data preprocessing, statistical summarization, and predictive analytics that are intrinsic to the closed-loop IoT decision-making life cycle. These are coupled with four stream workloads sourced from real IoT observations on smart cities and smart health, with peak streams rates that range from 500 to 10â€‰000Â messages/second from up to 3Â million sensors. We validate the RIoTBench suite for the popular Apache Storm DSPS on the Microsoft Azure public cloud and present empirical observations. This suite can be used by DSPS researchers for performance analysis and resource scheduling, by IoT practitioners to evaluate DSPS platforms, and even reused within IoT solutions.",,

Forecasts at daily and seasonal scale are vital for early warning, estimation of event frequency for hydraulic design, and long-term projections for developing adaptation strategies to future conditions. All three types of predictionsâ€”forecasts, frequency estimates, and projectionsâ€”typically treat droughts and floods independently, even though both types of extremes can be studied using related approaches and have similar challenges. In this review, we (a) identify challenges common to drought and flood prediction and their joint assessment and (b) discuss tractable approaches to tackle these challenges. We group challenges related to flood and drought prediction into four interrelated categories: data, process understanding, modeling and prediction, and humanâ€“water interactions. Data-related challenges include data availability and event definition. Process-related challenges include the multivariate and spatial characteristics of extremes, non-stationarities, and future changes in extremes. Modeling challenges arise in frequency analysis, stochastic, hydrological, earth system, and hydraulic modeling. Challenges with respect to humanâ€“water interactions lie in establishing links to impacts, representing humanâ€“water interactions, and science communication. We discuss potential ways of tackling these challenges including exploiting new data sources, studying droughts and floods in a joint framework, studying societal influences and compounding drivers, developing continuous stochastic models or non-stationary models, and obtaining stakeholder feedback. Tackling one or several of these challenges will improve flood and drought predictions and help to minimize the negative impacts of extreme events.

By exploiting widely distributed computing infrastructure that is located closer to the network edge, communication cost and service response time can be significantly reduced. However, developing this class of applications is not straightforward and requires addressing three key challenges, ie, supporting the dynamic nature of the edge network, managing the context-dependent characteristics of application logic, and dealing with the large scale of the system. In this paper, we present a case study in building fog computing applications using our open source platform Distributed Node-RED (DNR). In particular, we show how applications can be decomposed and deployed to a geographically distributed infrastructure using DNR, and how existing software components can be adapted and reused to participate in fog applications. We present a lab-based implementation of a fog application built using DNR that addresses the first two of the issues highlighted earlier. To validate that our approach also deals with large scale, we augment our live trial with a large scale simulation of the application model, conducted in Omnet++, which shows the scalability of the model and how it supports the dynamic nature of fog applications.",,

Humans show a remarkable aptitude for this, and can solve many different types of tasks, given definitions in the form of textual instructions and a small set of examples. Recent work with pre-trained language models mimics this learning style: users can define and exemplify a task for the model to attempt as a series of natural language prompts or instructions. While prompting approaches have led to higher cross-task generalization compared to traditional supervised learning, analyzing â€˜biasâ€™ in the task instructions given to the model is a difficult problem, and has thus been relatively unexplored. For instance, are we truly modeling a task, or are we modeling a user's instructions? To help investigate this, we develop LINGO, a novel visual analytics interface that supports an effective, task-driven workflow to (1) help identify bias in natural language task instructions, (2) alter (or create) task instructions to reduce bias, and (3) evaluate pre-trained model performance on debiased task instructions. To robustly evaluate LINGO, we conduct a user study with both novice and expert instruction creators, over a dataset of 1,616 linguistic tasks and their natural language instructions, spanning 55 different languages. For both user groups, LINGO promotes the creation of more difficult tasks for pre-trained models, that contain higher linguistic diversity and lower instruction bias. We additionally discuss how the insights learned in developing and evaluating LINGO can aid in the design of future dashboards that aim to minimize the effort involved in prompt creation across multiple domains.",,

It has been widely adopted as an alternative method to fund social, cultural, and technological projects. Crowdfunding platforms can capitalize the social and digital networks, making them more efficient in targeting funders with minimum operational costs. The emergence of crowdfunding platforms as social information systems attracts researchers and academicians to study their increasing acceptance. In complement to qualitative and big-data analyses, behavioral models can offer robust insights into why individuals like to participate in the activities generated on these platforms. Prior research focuses on the user's acceptance of these platforms, but less attention has been given to users' engagement in crowdfunding-based social welfare projects. The study highlights people's crowdfunding intentions to fund social welfare projects based on the elaboration likelihood model. The study hypothesizes argument quality and technical advantage as central signals and shared value and reputation as peripheral signals, where outcome efficacy and social consciousness directly affect intentions to participate and moderate the relationship between signals and intentions. We collect data from 467 potential donors from China's 30 online crowdfunding platforms. The results indicate a more significant peripheral route effect on donation participation in social welfare crowdfunding. Social consciousness significantly predicts donation intentions where outcome efficacy and social consciousness strengthen the relationship between argument quality, shared values, and donation intentions to participate in socially responsible crowdfunding.

We present results from a global survey of camera-trappers working across a diversity of institutions and habitats, and using camera traps for a range of purposes. We show that: (1) the major current constraints on effective camera-trapping are cost, theft and sensor performance (with 66%, 50% and 42% of respondents respectively classifying those as important or extremely important barriers for camera-trapping); (2) the most-needed technological developments are related to sensor performance (faster triggering responses and higher sensitivity), resistance to extreme environmental conditions (extreme temperatures and high humidity) and automated filtering of blank images; and (3) there is considerable variation among camera trap manufacturers in user-rated performance, and none of the manufacturer ratings exhibited a trend over time, despite improvements in the technology. Our results serve as valuable market research for both open-source and commercial camera trap developers. On the basis of our survey of camera-trappers, we foresee a transition towards camera-trapping 3.0 in the near-future, consisting of both more effective camera trap units, but also greater use of wireless data transmission, sensor networks, automation of processes using algorithms and better, more collaborative tools for managing and analysing camera trap data.

In this paper, we present a prototype implementation of such systems by developing a distributed privacy-preserving system, which has parts executing on smartphones as a mobile app, as well as a web-based application hosted on the cloud. The mobile app leverages Google Maps libraries to enhance the user experience in using the app. Mobile users can use the app to commute to their daily destinations while viewing relevant ads such as job openings in their neighborhood, discounts on favorite meals, etc. We developed a client-server privacy architecture that anonymizes the mobile user trajectories using a bounded perturbation strategy. A multi-modal sensing approach is proposed for modeling the context switching of the developed LBS system, which we represent as a Finite State Machine model. The multi-modal sensing approach can reduce the power consumed by mobile devices by automatically detecting sensing mode changes to avoid unnecessary sensing. The developed LBS system is organized into two parts: the business side and the user side. First, the business side allows business owners to create new ads by providing the ad details, Geo-location, photos, and any other instructions. Second, the user side allows mobile users to navigate through the map to see ads while walking, driving, bicycling, or quietly sitting in their offices. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the scalability and performance of the mobile side.

The prediction and explanation of academic performance and the investigation of the factors relating to the academic success and persistence of students are topics of utmost importance in higher education. Aims. The main aim of the present study is to develop and test a conceptual framework in a university context, where the effects of achievement goals, self-efficacy and class size on academic performance are hypothesized to be direct and indirect through study strategies. Sample. Participants were 553 students of different faculties from a university in Spain. Method. Pre-existing scales were used to develop the questionnaire. Questionnaires were group-administered in 21 classes during the first 2 weeks of May (i.e. about 1 month before the final examination). At the end of the academic year, students' grades were obtained from professors of each course. Results. Data were analysed through structural equation modelling. The results of the structural model provided support for most of the hypothesized relationships. Achievement goals and self-efficacy had no direct effects on performance, but results from the model comparison suggested that a mediational model provided a better fit to the data. Conclusions. Our study provides support for the key mediational role of study strategies in the effect of achievement goals and self-efficacy on academic performance. Self-efficacy seems to have the strongest indirect effect on performance. Mastery goals play a key role increasing deep processing and effort, and in turn affecting performance.

Our main result is that the hybrid system generated more accurate forecasts compared to a human-only baseline, which had no machine generated predictions. We found that skilled forecasters who had access to machine-generated forecasts outperformed those who only viewed historical data.

Through three years of data collection, the study finds that the context is rich in all three types of asymmetries and characterized by high uncertainty surrounding data as a resource. Actors engage in direct social exchanges to address information asymmetries and in generalized exchanges through intermediaries to deal with dependence and orientation asymmetries.

Nonetheless, using years-long electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, we previously found that patient-reported seizures consistently occur when interictal epileptiform activity (IEA) cyclically builds up over days. This multidien (multiday) interictalâ€“ictal relationship, which is shared across patients, may bear phasic information for forecasting seizures, even if individual patterns of seizure timing are unknown. To test this rigorously in a large retrospective dataset, we pretrained algorithms on data recorded from a group of patients, and forecasted seizures in other, previously unseen patients. Methods We used retrospective long-term data from participants (NÂ =Â 159) in the RNS System clinical trials, including intracranial EEG recordings (icEEG), and from two participants in the UNEEG Medical clinical trial of a subscalp EEG system (sqEEG). Based on IEA detections, we extracted instantaneous multidien phases and trained generalized linear models (GLMs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to forecast the probability of seizure occurrence at a 24-h horizon. Results With GLMs and RNNs, seizures could be forecasted above chance in 79% and 81% of previously unseen subjects with a median discrimination of area under the curve (AUC)Â =Â .70 and .69 and median Brier skill score (BSS)â€‰=â€‰.07 and .08. In direct comparison, individualized models had similar median performance (AUCÂ =Â .67, BSSÂ =Â .08), but for fewer subjects (60%). Moreover, calibration of pretrained models could be maintained to accommodate different seizure rates across subjects. Significance Our findings suggest that seizure forecasting based on multidien cycles of IEA can generalize across patients, and may drastically reduce the amount of data needed to issue forecasts for individuals who recently started collecting chronic EEG data. In addition, we show that this generalization is independent of the method used to record seizures (patient-reported vs. electrographic) or IEA (icEEG vs. sqEEG).",,

Here, the authors adopt the mean absolute temporal difference to identify the anomalies by motion block (MB) selection and localisation. SOOF features obtained from MB are used as motion descriptor for both normal and abnormal events. Simple and efficient K-means clustering is used to study the normal motion flow during the training.

The correct representation of vegetation phenology is important for models to accurately simulate the exchange of carbon, water, and energy between the vegetated land surface and the atmosphere. Remote sensing has advanced the monitoring of vegetation phenology by providing spatially and temporally continuous data that together with conventional ground observations offers a unique contribution to our knowledge about the environmental impact on ecosystems as well as the ecological adaptations and feedback to global climate change. Land surface phenology (LSP) is defined as the use of satellites to monitor seasonal dynamics in vegetated land surfaces and to estimate phenological transition dates. LSP, as an interdisciplinary subject among remote sensing, ecology, and biometeorology, has undergone rapid development over the past few decades. Recent advances in sensor technologies, as well as data fusion techniques, have enabled novel phenology retrieval algorithms that refine phenology details at even higher spatiotemporal resolutions, providing new insights into ecosystem dynamics. As such, here we summarize the recent advances in LSP and the associated opportunities for science applications.

Recent advances in convolutional neural networks may pave the way for new solutions. However, the primary task of individual pig detection under real-world conditions is still a challenging task. Previous studies used anchor-based frameworks that are unsuitable for such crowded scenarios with extreme overlapping. Furthermore, most applications focus on specific levels of brightness, farm facilities, or pig species without considering generalization. To tackle these problems, an anchor-free pig detection method based on pig centre localization is first proposed. Then, a novel negative training data augmentation technique is introduced using examples from outside the training distribution. Furthermore, using the test time augmentation technique is proposed to improve the model performance. Experiments are conducted on two online pig detection datasets; the network surpasses state-of-the-art results for both datasets. It is also found that the proposed method outperforms the latest anchor-free techniques commonly used in crowded scenarios. The method can detect pigs individually, even if their bounding boxes overlap strongly or occlude each other. Moreover, the real-time system achieves an improvement of 10% in Fmeasure$F_{\text{measure}}$ when testing in unconstrained real-worldÂ conditions.",,

As the most fine-grained information depicting the demand and supply of an asset, LOB data are essential in understanding market dynamics. Therefore, realistic LOB simulations offer a valuable methodology for explaining the empirical properties of markets. Mainstream simulation models include agent-based models (ABMs) and stochastic models (SMs). However, ABMs tend not to be grounded on real historical data, whereas SMs tend not to enable dynamic agent-interaction. More recently, deep generative approaches have been successfully implemented to tackle these issues, whereas its black-box essence hampers the explainability and transparency of the system. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel hybrid neural stochastic agent-based model (NS-ABM) for LOB simulation that incorporates a neural stochastic trader in agent-based simulation, characterised by (1) representing the aggregation of market events' logic by a neural stochastic background trader that is pre-trained on historical LOB data through a neural point process model; (2) learning the complex distribution for order-related attributes conditioned on various market indicators through a non-parametric diffusion probabilistic model; and (3) embedding the background trader in a multi-agent simulation platform to enable interaction with other strategic trading agents. We instantiate this hybrid NS-ABM model using the ABIDES platform. We first run the background trader in isolation and show that the simulated LOB can recreate a comprehensive list of stylised facts that demonstrate realistic market behaviour. We then introduce a population of â€˜trendâ€™ and â€˜valueâ€™ trading agents, which interact with the background trader. We show that the stylised facts remain and we demonstrate order flow impact and financial herding behaviours that are in accordance with empirical observations of real markets.",,

In this work, we propose a synthetic vision model that uses visual features to steer agents through dynamic environments. Our agents perceive optical flow resulting from their relative motion with the objects of the environment. The optical flow is then segmented and processed to extract visual features such as the focus of expansion and time-to-collision. Then, we establish the relations between these visual features and the agent motion, and use them to design a set of control functions which allow characters to perform object-dependent tasks, such as following, avoiding and reaching. Control functions are then combined to let characters perform more complex navigation tasks in dynamic environments, such as reaching a goal while avoiding multiple obstacles. Agent's motion is achieved by local minimization of these functions. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through a number of scenarios. Our work sets the basis for building a character animation system which imitates human sensorimotor actions. It opens new perspectives to achieve realistic simulation of human characters taking into account perceptual factors, such as the lighting conditions of the environment.",,

The enabling capabilities are those that research identifies as enablers of AI adoption, underscoring the competencies and routines needed to implement AI. The enhancing capabilities denote the role that AI adoption has in transforming or creating innovation capabilities in organizations. Second, we propose a taxonomy of AI applications that reflects the practical adoption of AI in relation to three underlying reasons: replace, reinforce, and reveal.

We propose an unsupervised method for abnormal event detection by combining multi-instance visual feature selection and the autoregressive integrated moving average model. In the proposed method, each video clip is modeled as a visual feature bag containing several subvideo clips, each of which is regarded as an instance. The time-transform characteristics of the optical flow characteristics within each subvideo clip are considered as a visual feature instance, and time-series modeling is carried out for multiple visual feature instances related to all subvideo clips in a surveillance video clip. The abnormal events in each surveillance video clip are detected using the multi-instance fusion method.

This article reports new research that followed a design science approach to develop and investigate a co-creative tool called Sport Sparks in one profession â€“ the coaching of professional football players. In response to a coach entering a text description of a coaching challenge (e.g., struggling to maintain the fitness of an athlete) into the tool, the tool automatically generated potentially novel ideas (e.g., reducing game time and changing their nutrition) that the coach could select and/or adapt and evolve into a simple action plan (e.g., which links nutrition to increased game time). This Sport Sparks tool was designed to be an example of human-centred artificial intelligence that aspires to empower humans, to deliver high levels of human control as well as automation, and empower people rather than emulate their expertise. It was engineered with rule-based reasoning to automate the generation of potential new ideas that coaches could select and refine during interactions which provide high user control over this automation. The potential of such a co-creative tool, and value of the guidelines, were demonstrated during the tool's evaluation by coaching practitioners at a Premier League football club. The practitioners used the tool to generate new ideas to coaching challenges, and reported evidence of different forms of creative thinking, although some also reported the need for more support for creative collaborations and solution planning. The paper ends by discussing future directions for both the Sport Sparks tool and other co-creative AI tools.",,

We recently carried out two different studies on fences in a French context whose results corroborate this observation, and highlight the need to synthetise and prioritise scientific and technical research. The first study was an exploratory research project on escape devices used to allow ungulates to exit fenced transport infrastructure right-of-way. The second study entailed drafting a guide on the mitigation of the fence's ecological impacts, using solar energy plants as a case study. Both were based on different types of information gathering, ranging from bibliographical research to interviews with governments officials, operating companies, engineering offices, naturalists and hunters' associations. Based on the similarities between these two studies, the urgency of certain needs, and the clear potential for these approaches to extend beyond France's borders, we have identified two key categories for future actions. The first category is a series of six research priorities: Diversifying monitoring of exclusion fencing; Developing practice-oriented fence mapping tools; Further studying the impact of fencing on animal vehicle collisions; Considering animal behaviour in monitoring protocol; Ex-situ testing of devices' effectiveness; and Studying large-scale effects of fencing. The second category comprises six method recommendations: Accurately documenting fences; Early planning of scientific monitoring; Contextualising fencing requirements; Defining effectiveness goals and criteria; Taking advantage of opportunistic Animal-Fence Event observations; and Developing artificial intelligence and computer vision to map fences. All these items are supported by examples drawn from one study or the other. Our conclusions indicate that, in the context of major expansion of fences, such recommendations must be integrated at all stages of development work. If this is not implemented, the free movement of animal species will not be adequately protected and the erosion of biodiversity will be further exacerbated.",,

It is still challenging to detect anomalies in a static object. To manage this objective, we focus on changes in the position of a stationary object in videos. In a normal scenario, the pixel values of the static object are fixed while in abnormal motion the fixed values change. We introduce a new concept to determine anomalies based on manual annotations in each video frame, only over a part of a static object in a frame such that it can be taken as a reference for the whole. Through color channel splitting we determine mask image, from which handcrafted features such as scratch area, perimeter, equivalent diameter and density are calculated. In the next step, we analyze frame-wise changes in feature values using a linear regression model, feature values are constant when the object remains stationary while there is a rise or fall in values when an object changes location. We classify feature values through anomaly scores and thresholds. In this model, we are evaluating our proposed framework on 12 real-time video datasets. Results are compared with existing techniques which are outperforming in terms of accuracy, mean square error and area under the curve.",,

Starting from the beginning of 2010s and highly motivating after 2014, crowdsourcing-driven meteorological services have evolved from a single collection and observation of data to the systematic acquisition, analysis and application of these data. In this review, by focusing on papers and databases that have combined crowdsourcing methods to promote or implement meteorological knowledge services, we analysed the relevant literature in three dimensions: data collection, information analysis and meteorological knowledge applications. First, we selected the potential data sources for crowdsourcing and discussed the characteristics of the collected data in four dimensions: consciousness, objectiveness, mobility and multidisciplinary. Second, based on the purpose of these studies and the extent of utilizing data as well as knowledge, we categorize the crowdsourcing-based meteorological analysis into three levels: relationship discovery, knowledge generalization and systemized service. Third, according to the application scenario, we discussed the applications that have already been put into use, and we suggest current challenges and future research directions. These previous studies show that the use of crowdsourcing in social space can expand the coverage as well as enhance the performance of meteorological service.

For sentence acoustic feature learning, a regional attention mechanism is introduced to extract multi-scale sentence features; for segment acoustic feature extraction, the traditional attention mechanism is used to calculate, which is in line with human cognitive mechanism. In addition, a periodic focal loss function is introduced to address the imbalance of positive and negative samples in depression diagnosis. Experiments show that the proposed acoustic depression recognition model has a certain improvement in recognition performance compared with other methods. At the same time, the influence of noise on the recognition of acoustic depression in the real consultation environment is analysed through experiments, and the data enhancement is carried out utilising speech noise, which proves the effectiveness of the data expansion of speech noise.",,

Agent-based model (ABM) is a traditional method to simulate activities in a complex system, which has been widely applied in urban studies. However, due to its rigid initial settings, ABM has been criticized for its lack of intelligence, especially in dealing with modern urban issues. With the success of artificial intelligence (AI) and complexity science, it is generally agreed that ABM can be enhanced with AI agents, a promising technology that can bridge the gaps. For that, this article provides a systematic review, in which 10 subsections correspond to 10 different ways that AI can work with ABM in the methodological framework. The sections include that (1) ABM is Al; (2) ABM provides training data for Al; (3) Al provides data for ABM; (4) ABM is a submodule in the ensemble Al; (5) Al leads an optimization framework with ABM participation; (6) Al tunes ABM initialization parameters; (7) Al provides the environment for ABM; (8) Al aids in choosing the agent's attributes; (9) Al provides behaviors for agents in ABM; (10) Al helps to evaluate the performance of ABM.

Due to the recent rapid spread of wearable sensors and smart devices with access to social media, migrating health services from the traditional centre-based health system to personal health care is inevitable. In this current era of greater personalization, treating patients' health problems according to their profile and medical data gathered is possible using the latest information technologies. Consequently, personalized health recommender systems have gained importance. Empowering the utility of advanced Web technology in personalized health systems is still challenging due to pressing issues, such as lack of low cost and accurate smart medical sensors and wearable devices, existing investment in legacy Web system architecture in health sector, heterogeneity of medical data gathered by myriad health care institutions and isolated health services, and interoperability issues as well as multi-dimensionality of medical data.

The unpredictability of seizures can heighten fear and anxiety in people with epilepsy, making it difficult to take part in day-to-day activities. Epilepsy researchers have prioritized developing seizure prediction algorithms to combat episodic seizures for decades, but the utility and effectiveness of prediction algorithms has not been investigated thoroughly in clinical settings. In contrast, seizure forecasts, which theoretically provide the probability of a seizure at any time (as opposed to predicting the next seizure occurrence), may be more feasible. Many advances have been made over the past decade in the field of seizure forecasting, including improvements in algorithms as a result of machine learning and exploration of nonâ€“EEG-based measures of seizure susceptibility, such as physiological biomarkers, behavioral changes, environmental drivers, and cyclic seizure patterns. For example, recent work investigating periodicities in individual seizure patterns has determined that more than 90% of people have circadian rhythms in their seizures, and many also experience multiday, weekly, or longer cycles. Other potential indicators of seizure susceptibility include stress levels, heart rate, and sleep quality, all of which have the potential to be captured noninvasively over long time scales. There are many possible applications of a seizure-forecasting device, including improving quality of life for people with epilepsy, guiding treatment plans and medication titration, optimizing presurgical monitoring, and focusing scientific research. To realize this potential, it is vital to better understand the user requirements of a seizure-forecasting device, continue to advance forecasting algorithms, and design clear guidelines for prospective clinical trials of seizure forecasting.",,

Stochastic techniques or machine learning techniques, which can be used to predict the future states of an adversary robot demand high computation and thus, power. Advanced RNN techniques like long short-term memory, which can make predictions using long-term dependencies of the sequence data, also have extremely high computing and memory requirements. Thus, the systems involved in using these former techniques are not appropriate to be deployed in fields which require inconspicuous monitoring. In this work, we present two novel methods using the â€œbehaviorâ€ to predict the future states of an adversary robot which can be deployed using a low computing device/small single board computer/robot in a non-GPS environment without any internet connection. The proposed two methods are based on a list and a graph, respectively. Unlike the most available literature, where the prediction is based on â€œtime,â€ our model predicts the future state using the states of the system. These methods work for both single and multiple-looped paths taken by the adversary robot. The results show that the prediction error which depends on the predicted move and the actual move taken by the robot decreases as a logarithmic function and is comparatively lower when the adversary robot follows a path having multiple loops.",,

Existing real-time reconstruction methods typically do not take the point of interest into account, and thus might fail to produce clean reconstruction results of desired objects due to distracting objects or backgrounds. In addition, any changes in background during scanning, which can often occur in real scenarios, can easily break up the whole reconstruction process. To address these issues, we incorporate visual saliency into a traditional real-time volumetric fusion pipeline. Salient regions detected from RGB-D frames suggest user-intended objects, and by understanding user intentions our approach can put more emphasis on important targets, and meanwhile, eliminate disturbance of non-important objects. Experimental results on real-world scans demonstrate that our system is capable of effectively acquiring geometric information of salient objects in cluttered real-world scenes, even if the backgrounds are changing.",,

Research on humanâ€“machine interactions has been conducted within different disciplinary silos, resulting in social science models that underestimate technology and vice versa.

There are several inhibitors and motivations related factors to determine whether one can embrace the cloud services or not. Therefore, this paper presents a holistic and flexible cloud decision framework by taking a wide spectrum weighted factors related to the acceptance or denial of the cloud services. To have sustainable decision and obviating the shortcomings of the existing approaches on the cloud service adoption, a deep understanding of organisation's business process requirements and cost implications is required. To utilise the proposed model, the functional and non-functional requirements associated to the business process of an adopter organisation must be specified. To reach a concrete decision, a hybrid approach is applied by incorporating the analytic hierarchy process and Delphi methods to prevent subjective outcomes and to have diverse experiences at the same time. To support the decision model, some economic theories and Moore law are used. To verify the proposed model, a Telecommunication Company is considered as a case study for its 6-year plan of investment. The simulation results of conducted scenarios for the mentioned mid-scale case study prove that it is logical to establish on-premises a private datacenter and utilising the hybrid deployment once it encounters abrupt burst of resource demand.

Different from modern large-scale buildings, ancient architectural complex is composed of a large number of scattered low buildings with inconsistent facility specifications and simple structure, so it does not have the conditions to deploy unified electrical lines and establish traditional large-scale circuit monitoring system. In this study, we design an electrical fire monitoring IoT (EFM-IoT) framework, which can realize early fire warning by monitoring the residual current of appliances and is easy to deploy in ancient buildings. EFM-IoT adopts the data cleaning mechanism based on report form to filter redundant data, reducing computing and storage pressure in the cloud.

The WSN-IoT network generates huge volume of data, which has to be processed and accessed by the remote users. Due to this large volume of data generation and resource constraint ability make achieving optimal cluster based routing in WSN-IoT. The location of the sensor nodes significantly affects the accuracy of the information collected, which determines the quality of service provided by the application system. WSN can have multiple conflicts, which can create different coverage holes. These holes will break the existing overlap or connection and affect the required operation of the networks. Therefore, it is essential to find and repair the coverage holes to ensure the full functioning of the WSN as a motivation of this study. In this paper, we suggest a novel Coverage Hole aware Optimal Cluster based Routing (CHOCR) scheme for WSN-IoT. First, we propose Modified Lichtenberg optimization (MLO) algorithm for balanced clustering which improve the performance of coverage hole. Second, we develop a linear equilibrium optimization based decision making (LEO-DM) technique to subtract trust value of each IoT node using multiple restraints in cluster and consider the highest trusted node is act as cluster head (CH). After that, a hybrid deep recurrent neural network (HD-RNN) is developed for intermediate node selection to frame the routing between two nodes. Finally, we simulate our proposed CHOCR scheme on the NS3.26 simulator. According to energy consumption, network longevity, number of nodes that are still alive and packet delivery ratio, packet loss ratio and throughput, end-to-end latency and delay of our proposed CHOCR routing system, we compare it to other current routing schemes.",,

Realistic insect swarm simulation is difficult due to two challenges: high-fidelity behaviors and large scales, which make the simulation practice subject to laborious manual work and excessive trial-and-error processes. To address both challenges, we present a novel data-driven framework, FASTSWARM, to model complex behaviors of flying insects based on real-world data and simulate plausible animations of flying insect swarms. FASTSWARM has a linear time complexity and achieves real-time performance for large swarms. The high-fidelity behavior model of FASTSWARM explicitly takes into consideration the most common behaviors of flying insects, including the interactions among insects such as repulsion and attraction, self-propelled behaviors such as target following and obstacle avoidance, and other characteristics such as random movements. To achieve scalability, an energy minimization problem is formed with different behaviors modeled as energy terms, where the minimizer is the desired behavior. The minimizer is computed from the real-world data, which ensures the plausibility of the simulation results. Extensive simulation results and evaluations show that FASTSWARM is versatile in simulating various swarm behaviors, high fidelity measured by various metrics, easily controllable in inducing user controls and highly scalable.",,

Although existing research shows promising results in the vehicle control using video from a monocular dash camera, there has been very limited work on directly learning vehicle control from motion-based cues. Such cues are powerful features for visual representations, as they encode the per-pixel movement between two consecutive images, allowing a system to effectively map the features into the control signal. The authors propose a new framework that exploits the use of a motion-based feature known as optical flow extracted from the dash camera and demonstrates that such a feature is effective in significantly improving the accuracy of the control signals. The proposed framework involves two main components. The flow predictor, as a self-supervised deep network, models the underlying scene structure from consecutive frames and generates the optical flow. The controller, as a supervised multi-task deep network, predicts both steer angle and speed. The authors demonstrate that the proposed framework using the optical flow features can effectively predict control signals from a dash camera video.

However, no research to date has detected animals in complex heterogeneous environments or detected elephants from space using very-high-resolution satellite imagery and deep learning. In this study, we apply a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically detect and count African elephants in a woodland savanna ecosystem in South Africa. We use WorldView-3 and 4 satellite data â€“the highest resolution satellite imagery commercially available. We train and test the model on 11 images from 2014 to 2019. We compare the performance accuracy of the CNN against human accuracy. Additionally, we apply the model on a coarser resolution satellite image (GeoEye-1) captured in Kenya, without any additional training data, to test if the algorithm can generalize to an elephant population outside of the training area. Our results show that the CNN performs with high accuracy, comparable to human detection capabilities. The detection accuracy (i.e., F2 score) of the CNN models was 0.78 in heterogeneous areas and 0.73 in homogenous areas. This compares with the detection accuracy of the human labels with an averaged F2 score 0.77 in heterogeneous areas and 0.80 in homogenous areas. The CNN model can generalize to detect elephants in a different geographical location and from a lower resolution satellite. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of applying state-of-the-art satellite remote sensing and deep learning technologies for detecting and counting African elephants in heterogeneous landscapes.

However, this algorithm cannot regenerate continuity and diversity of pedestrian motions in real data, leading to defects in motion fidelity. Otherwise, trajectory prediction methods based on deep learning have progressed in real pedestrians movement patterns mining. However, they are rarely applied in simulation due to the lack of ability to avoid collision and adapt to manufactured scenarios. Our work proposes a simulation method DeepORCA that integrates ORCA with a CVAE-based velocity probability generator, which can model motion continuity, variable intentions, and scene semantics. Moreover, DeepORCA converts the velocity optimization into quadratic programming, which accelerates the calculation while maintaining the collision-avoidance ability of ORCA. In the experiments of real and artificial scenes, our method produces more realistic crowd simulation results than ORCA quantitatively and qualitatively, while keeps the computational efficiency at the same order of magnitude.",,

Specifically, human mobility, travel history, and other transport statistics have significantly impact on the spread of any infectious disease. This article proposes a spatio-temporal knowledge mining framework, named STOPPAGE, to model the impact of human mobility and other contextual information over the large geographic areas in different temporal scales. The framework has two key modules: (i) spatio-temporal data and computing infrastructure using fog/edge based architecture; and (ii) spatio-temporal data analytics module to efficiently extract knowledge from heterogeneous data sources. We created a pandemic-knowledge graph to discover correlations among mobility information and disease spread, a deep learning architecture to predict the next hotspot zones.

Object tracking is the significant task in such systems, and hence it is essential to review the standard approaches dealing with object detection, classification and tracking. This work proposes a novel classification technique for a detected object of a moving scene from a video dataset. Initially the dataset has been processed and prepared for data training based on neural networks. The data has been classified using the proposed enhanced deep belief based multilayered convolutional neural network (EBMCNN). The major focus is on deep learning applications involved in estimating the count, total persons involved and the activities in a crowd where all criteria are taken into consideration, thereby achieving security through video analysis. Identifying theft and the detection of violence are some security measures where video is converted to frames which are then processed to analyse the individuals along with their activities. The classification is performed through comparative analysis of a real-time dataset. Experimental results show the accuracy 97%, precision 93.8%, recall 87.7% and F-1 score 87.5%.",,

However, such complex paradigms do not scale easily and are not traditionally implemented in resource-constrained smart cameras for on-device processing which offers significant advantages in situations when real-time monitoring and privacy are vital. This work addresses the challenge of achieving a good trade-off between accuracy and speed for efficient deep-learning-based pedestrian detection in smart camera applications. The contributions of this work are the following: 1) a computationally efficient architecture based on separable convolutions that integrates dense connections across layers and multi-scale feature fusion to improve representational capacity while decreasing the number of parameters and operations, 2) a more elaborate loss function for improved localization, 3) and an anchor-less approach for detection. The proposed approach referred to as YOLOpeds is evaluated using the PETS2009 surveillance dataset on 320â€‰Ã—â€‰320 images. A real-system implementation is presented using the Jetson TX2 embedded platform.

This nascent but rapidly growing intersection of scholarship holds the potential to help us better understand poverty by leveraging big data and recent advances in machine vision. In this study, we statistically analyse the literature in the expanding field of welfare and poverty predictions from the combination of machine learning and satellite imagery. Here, we apply an integrative review method to extract key data on factors related to the predictive power of welfare. We found that the most important factors correlated to the predictive power of welfare are the number of pre-processing steps employed, the number of datasets used, the type of welfare indicator targeted and the choice of AI model. Studies that used stock measure indicators (assets) as targets achieved better performanceâ€”17 percentage points higherâ€”in predicting welfare than those that targeted flow measures (income and consumption) ones. Additionally, we found that the combination of machine learning and deep learning significantly increases predictive powerâ€”by as much as 15 percentage pointsâ€”compared to using either alone. Surprisingly, we found that the spatial resolution of the satellite imagery used is important but not critical to the performance as the relationship is positive but not statistically significant. These findings have important implications for future research in this domain and for anyone aspiring to use the methodology.",,

Small target detection algorithms were widely used in industry, agriculture and other fields. But the small target had few available features and the loss of small target detail information in feature extraction. So it led to the low accuracy of the small target detection algorithms. In this paper, we proposed DBF-YOLO algorithm based on the classical YOLOV5. The classical YOLOV5 algorithm with high speed. The detection speed of the minimum model could reach 24â€‰ms. However, the deep network structure led to the low detection accuracy of small targets. Our proposed DBF-YOLO algorithm was an improvement on the problem of small target information being lost.

Second, by adding the feature fusion network of shallow feature map and the detection output part in the FPNâ€‰+â€‰PAN layers, the algorithm's accuracy and generalization ability were significantly enhanced.

The primary goal of P-Reid is to recognize a person based on previous appearance in multiview surveillance videos. The mainstream approaches apply fully supervised learning techniques that have poor scalability when deployed in complex real-world scenes, due to the overfitting problem, caused by the lack of sufficient annotated data. Further, optimization of these models for unlabeled data in real-time surveillance is a challenging task. To tackle these issues, an intelligent framework (LR-Net) is proposed, consisting of three tiers including fine-tuning (FT), siamese network (SN), and fusion strategy (FS). In the first tier, a deep learning model is fine-tuned for P-Reid that can handle both labeled and unlabeled data. Next, with the assistance of transfer learning, an SN is proposed that has a strong discriminative capability in terms of similarity between a pair of images. Finally, a learning-to-rank strategy is applied to optimize the learning capability of the SN, in which a triplet network extracts spatial-temporal patterns from unlabeled samples. In addition, a bayesian fusion model (BFM) is introduced to integrate the spatiotemporal and visual features, which yields 4.4%, 9.3%, and 0.8% improvement in the matching score over Market-1501, DukeMCMT-reID, and CUHK03 data sets, respectively. The conducted experiments and ablation study on the benchmark data sets empirically validate the proposed system, which obtains a high Rank-1 score as compared with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",,

To handle this data, effective data storage and management has required. Cloud computing (CC) is a promising solution to deal with this huge amount of data. Electronic devices are collecting real-time data from sensors and applications through a wireless communication channel in the digital era. In some cases, CC cannot protect against various malicious attacks in the wireless communication channel. To address this issue, we have used machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for attack detection in a wireless channel on an early basis. It trains a model to predict malicious activities of attackers, which aids in the security of CC's sensitive data. We employed adversarial learning techniques (AL) to add fake data into the model to ensure that the trained model was correct. The trained model can distinguish between the fake and real data from the training samples and improve the training samples' performance. AL provides different defense mechanisms to preserve the privacy of ML- and DL-based model but does not ensure the system's robustness. To improve the system's robustness, we have used federated learning with blockchain technology to make a system more robust, reliable, accurate, and transparent. This integration aids in providing high-graded security against adversarial attacks. This paper presents a comprehensive review to highlight the recent improvements in AL techniques. Moreover, we explored the various AL applications in security and privacy preservation. Finally, open research issues and future directions are discussed to show future research avenues.",,

Our innovation lies in modeling the dynamic movement of passengers within a metro system over time as a state transition process aligned with the train schedule. To achieve this, we introduce a spatio-temporal deep learning framework, denoted as STnet, designed to dynamically predict these state transitions.

Firstly, the popular network models are sensitive to scale variance of human head, human occlusions, and complex background due to repeated utilization of vanilla convolution kernels. Secondly, the vanilla feature fusion often depends on summation or concatenation, which ignores the correlation of different features leading to information redundancy and low robustness to background noise. To address these issues, a multi-scale feature pyramid network (MFP-Net) for dense crowd counting is proposed in this paper. The proposed MFP-Net makes two contributions. Firstly, the feature pyramid fusion module is designed that adopts rich convolutions with different depths and scales, not only to expand the receptive field, but also to improve the inference speed of models by using parallel group convolution. Secondly, a feature attention-aware module is added in the feature fusion stage. The module can achieve local and global information fusion by capturing the importance of the spatial and channel domains to improve model robustness. The proposed MFP-Net is evaluated on five publicly available datasets, and experiments show that the MFP-Net not only provides better crowd counting results than comparative models, but also requires fewerÂ parameters.",,
